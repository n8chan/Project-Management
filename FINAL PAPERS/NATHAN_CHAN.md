Spotty: A Social Music Rating App

Project Vision

The Spotty project was created from a passion for music and digital interaction. As streaming services become more ubiquitous, a gap persists in how users share and discover music through personal and communal expression. Spotty aims to close that gap by building a social music discovery platform that combines rating and review functions with real-time local and networked trends. It is built on principles of open collaboration, distributed community input, and an agile approach to iterative development. The community Spotty serves includes college students, hobbyist music critics, and everyday listeners who value shared taste and social insight. The hope is to build a peer-driven, flexible app that expands musical discovery beyond the algorithm and into the community.

Why This Project and Community Matter

This project is personally meaningful because it builds on everyday musical habits while inviting users to be more than consumers. As someone who has found musical communities meaningful and identity-shaping, the absence of deeper tools for social commentary and collaborative curation on platforms like Spotify is noticeable. The Spotty platform responds to this lack, giving users the tools to express themselves musically, be heard, and discover music through others in a way that reflects real-world social dynamics. It applies “working open” practices not only in its development philosophy but in the way users engage with the product and with each other. This mirrors a broader interest in digital culture and participatory media that values peer production and interaction.

How Spotty Will Be Built and Managed

Although the project includes coding and technical execution, much of its success depends on community workflows and iterative collaboration. Spotty is organized using GitHub and version control tools to enable transparency. It integrates project boards, issues, and milestones to facilitate agile development. Each sprint involves research, design, feedback, testing, and adjustment. A roadmap is publicly accessible, allowing for user and contributor input. Weekly progress updates, public demo sessions, and an onboarding pipeline for contributors help maintain steady development. Community-building efforts include a Discord forum, regular check-ins, newsletters, and contributor badges to recognize participation. Discourse-style trust levels may be implemented to manage permissions and quality. In this way, Spotty's project management strategy balances both organizational structure and organic collaboration, aligning with principles outlined throughout this course.

Concepts from the Course and Optional Readings

The Spotty project integrates five key principles from this course and its recommended readings:

Working Open (Mozilla Foundation): Spotty encourages transparency and community participation at every level, including roadmap visibility, open documentation, and modular feature contributions.

Open Source Project Management (Fogel, 2005): Following Fogel’s guidelines, Spotty will use contributor-friendly GitHub workflows, assign maintainers, and foster an inclusive environment with clear contribution guidelines.

Agile Practice (PMI, 2017): Spotty implements sprint planning, retrospectives, user feedback loops, and iterative releases, following agile techniques to adapt to changing needs.

Open Education and Adaptability (Jhangiani & Biswas-Diener, 2017): Openness in both technical and social dimensions guides Spotty’s scalability and responsiveness to community feedback.

Project Lifecycle Phases (Watt, 2014): The project is divided into clearly defined phases, each with specific tasks, goals, and feedback checkpoints. These stages reflect core project management standards that help manage complexity across distributed teams.

Workflow and Development Timeline

Phase 1: Initial Setup (Weeks 0–4)

Assign roles, define scope, and configure GitHub repository and boards.

Initiate community channels and organize a contributor orientation.

Set baseline documentation and draft development goals.

Phase 2: User Research (Weeks 4–8)

Distribute surveys and run interviews with music listeners across campuses.

Map pain points and aspirations into design specifications.

Use affinity diagrams and persona building to identify key user groups.

Phase 3: Design (Weeks 8–11)

Create wireframes and prototype flows in Figma.

Open feedback cycle for early contributors and advisors.

Integrate user flow testing to evaluate navigation clarity.

Phase 4: Usability Testing (Weeks 11–13)

Test core flows with target users.

Iterate designs based on usability data.

Document testing outcomes and prioritize high-impact revisions.

Phase 5: Front-End Implementation (Weeks 13–17)

Use React Native and Expo to build modular screens.

Integrate visual branding and responsive behaviors.

Ensure accessibility compliance using WCAG 2.1 standards.

Phase 6: Back-End Development (Weeks 17–22)

Implement Firebase authentication and Spotify API endpoints.

Construct the core data structure for ratings and feeds.

Establish secure data flow and redundancy protocols.

Phase 7: Beta Testing (Weeks 22–24)

Release to a test group of 30 users from three universities.

Collect engagement data and bug reports.

Implement real-time analytics through PostHog and update documentation.

Phase 8: Launch (Week 25)

Submit to iOS and Google Play stores.

Promote on college music boards, Discord, and Reddit forums.

Monitor app feedback and roll out first post-launch patch.

Sustainability and Scalability

Spotty’s post-launch strategy includes scaling through MVP refinement and expansion of its contributor base. All documentation will be maintained in a ReadtheDocs format and supplemented with how-to videos and contributor guides. Sustainability hinges on balancing user growth with server resources, managing scope creep, and adapting features based on data and feedback. Regular community sprints, a modular codebase, and the use of automated testing tools will help reduce technical debt, as advised in Reflection #2. A content moderation roadmap will also be established to address growing user activity and maintain healthy community norms.

To scale effectively, Spotty will follow OKRs that align both development and community goals. Success will be measured not only by new downloads but also by increases in active user participation, contributor engagement, and playlist shares. Feedback boards and bi-weekly community calls will encourage continued input from users, while project maintainers will meet monthly to review progress and reallocate resources as needed. By continuously adapting its organizational structure, Spotty remains responsive and forward-looking.

Conclusion

Spotty is more than a music app. It is a collaborative platform for music lovers to engage critically, socially, and creatively with the music they consume. By integrating key principles from open-source development, community-based collaboration, and agile project management, Spotty redefines what it means to listen socially. The project reflects a synthesis of the lessons learned in IS 340—especially those related to working open, technical sustainability, and scalable community management. Ultimately, Spotty demonstrates how students can design projects that connect personal passion with practical, distributed innovation.

## Abstract  
Mental health is a very large and increasing issue today, especially for college students, due to the overwhelming nature of university. It is a deeply personal issue, but it does affect collaborative environments. As someone who has experienced the emotional highs and lows of academic and creative work, I’ve understood how difficult it is to maintain mental wellness while still being productive. Traditional mental health apps often focus too much on metrics and feel impersonal. I aimed to create something that offers a soft support system that allows users to reflect on their feelings and needs without requiring too much work or investment. I decided on MoodOpen as a mental health toolkit that provides simple support through journaling, mood and gratitude tracking, and general emotional self-awareness tools. This paper details how I would use open-source principles and platforms to ensure sustainability and uniqueness with the project. 

## Introduction
MoodOpen is a center for mental wellness tools that users can use and modify based on their individual emotional needs. These tools would not be tied to a specific platform and do not require any additional installations. It will include a CSV-based mood tracker for users to input a daily mood score, stress level, and any additional notes they want to include. It will also include a markdown-based journaling template with introspective prompts to guide users to reflect more deeply and consistently, a gratitude log in a plaintext checklist, and a contributor-written resource list for mental health in digital spaces. The goal with this project is not to just optimize mental wellness but to support users for daily reflection and emotional regulation in a low-pressure way that is not too intrusive. The tools included are simple, but the underlying system I would use to manage and grow this project is very intentional and meaningful. I chose to use open-source tools like GitHub because these kinds of tools support collaboration, documentation, and transparency, and they allow me to support my belief for care-based resources to be free and accessible to everyone.

## Vision
My vision for MoodOpen is to build an open and modular mental wellness toolkit that is accessible for anyone to adapt and contribute to. I would want to manage this project in a way that allows emotional wellness to be a shared effort rather than just a personal struggle to deal with. By using these open-source principles, I believe I can make the project accessible and participatory. Anyone should feel welcome to share prompts, tools, and any improvements they want to contribute. While the project utilizes open-source methods, I would maintain editorial control over any changes and additions. This is to allow the project to remain safe and consistent while still welcoming suggestions and ideas from others.

## Process
Open-source development allows transparency, collaboration, and sustainability in the long-term. I would manage MoodOpen using GitHub, having a clear repository structure and open documentation. However, only approved contributors would have write access to the core repository.  I would design the repository to include README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and multiple modular folders for the different tools like /moodtracker, /journal, /gratitude, and /resources. Each of these folders would have examples, instructions, and templates that can be edited. I would also incorporate version control, using GitHub to track every change to allow users to see the full evolution of the project, and having commit messages explain the rationale behind each update. Having this transparency helps users have more trust in the process. I would incorporate issue tracking but opening GitHub issues with detailed labels for idea submissions and bug reports, but only selected contributors would resolve them. Additionally, all these changes would go through pull requests with checklists and automated formatting checks in order to maintain consistency and quality. By making the process relatively transparent, users are able to understand how the project changes and grows and how they can contribute. I would follow a structured and phased process based on open-source development cycles in order to build MoodOpen from scratch. 

## Phase 1: Planning and Design
I would start by defining the scope by determining what tools (likely mood tracking, journal, gratitude log, resources) should be included in the first version. I would sketch out how each module should function such as what questions would be given as journal prompts, what columns should go in the mood tracker, etc. I would then choose the formats for the projects which would be lightweight and universally accessible formats like CSV, markdown, and plaintext.

## Phase 2: Setting up GitHub Repository
I would create a GitHub repository with a clear folder structure, such as /tracker, /journal, /gratitude, and /resources. I would then add documentation using a README.md to explain what the project is, a CONTRIBUTIONS.md for guidelines on how to provide feedback, and likely a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to make sure all engagement is respectful and fair. I would then initialize version control and use GitHub to track every file and change, even in our early drafts. 

## Phase 3:Developing Tools
To start developing the mood tracker using a CSV format, I would create a simple spreadsheet format with fields for the date, ranking mood (1-5), stress level, and optional notes. I would add instructions for this in a README.md. I would create the journal template in markdown format by designing daily prompts like “What are some good things that happened to me today?” and “What am I feeling today?” This section could include sample entries along with a blank version. To create the gratitude log using a plaintext format I would make a running checklist for users to add three things they are grateful for every day. I would make sure to keep this section simple. Lastly, to create a resource list using a markdown format, I would curate a list of digital mental health and wellness resources, along with brief context for each one (what it is for and how it can help). This section would especially invite suggestions via GitHub issues. 

## Phase 4: Internal Testing and Feedback
In order to begin internal testing, I would self-test by using each tool for a week, while taking notes on usability, clarity, and the emotional tone. I would make any edits necessary and then get peer feedback by asking a few trusted friends and family to try it for a week and provide anonymous feedback using a Google Form. Based on their feedback, I would modify the wording, organization, and formatting of the tools to make them more intuitive and supportive.

## Phase 5: Public Launch
In this phase, I will create the first release - I would tag a version (v1.0) and write notes that explain what is included in this version. I would make this easy to use by having download buttons for users to get the toolkit without using GitHub. Once I release this first version, I would promote it by sharing it to my friends and family, along with any mental health-friendly online spaces and groups that I feel it could benefit.

## Phase 6: Ongoing Maintenance
After making any modifications to the first version based on user feedback, I would continue monitoring and modifying the project. I would create a future_ideas.md with any feature requests and ideas that I am not able to build immediately but want to implement when possible. I will also schedule reminders for me to revisit the project frequently to resolve any small issues that might arise and merge feedback. Throughout the process I would document everything using GitHub’s issues and changelog to keep a transparent log of all the updates. 

## Principles and Strategies
Based on our class readings and discussions, I identified three core working open principles that I would use to guide this project. Firstly, transparency - every update, decision, and structural changes would be documented. Thus includes keeping up with a consistent changelog, publishing any design rationale for the main features, and using open discussions for all significant project decisions. Additionally, markdown files would be used to explain the purpose and context of each tool included, such as how to interpret the mood tracker entries or why a new journaling prompt is useful. These explanations will ensure that this project is accessible to everyone, even those without technical backgrounds. Discussions will also be public so that others can follow the evolution of this project and potentially even learn from the development process. 
Second, modularity - the tools would be divided into clear sections that allow users to choose what they want to use. For instance, if someone only wants to use the gratitude checklist but does not want to engage with the journaling or mood tracking features, they can do so. Each module would be standalone, including their own documentation and template files, which improves usability and long-term maintenance. This not only reduces friction for all first-time users but also makes the project easier to scale or to update individual parts without disrupting the rest of the project.
Lastly, intentional participation - any community ideas and feedback would be welcomed through Issues and Discussions on GitHub. Although only reviewed contributions would be integrated in order to maintain safety and accuracy, this allows all users to help shape and improve the project. There would also be clear guidelines given to contributors for how to propose changes and suggest journaling prompts. A CONTRIBUTIONS.md file would also outline the expectations and the kind of input that would be most helpful. This brings down the barrier to participation but still preserves a respectful and collaborative community environment. 
I would also use strategies to thoughtfully manage this project because of how key structure and empathy are to good project management. I would ensure scoping and prioritization, by starting with a small and stable assortment of tools  - like the mood tracker, journal, and gratitude log - before considering expansions, like formatting for mobile devices or multilingual translation options. This avoids having too many feature implementations at once and keeps the focus on the core user experience. I also would prioritize thorough and human-centered documentation and make sure every tool and modification includes an explanation of why it exists and how it can be useful. Even any minor updates would be accompanied with notes that help explain the motivation behind that change to help new users and future contributors to grasp the reasoning behind each decision. 
Together, all of these practices would help create a strong foundation for a personally meaningful and sustainable project - even if the project is not fully open to public edits. Open-source principles can still be implemented with care and purpose which will help balance the personal nature of the project with collective insights. 

## Community Engagement Plan
Since MoodOpen accepts community feedback but is not fully open to edits, the community participation will focus on this dialogue and suggestions rather than direct modification. This kind of engagement prioritizes reflection and contribution more than unrestricted editing, which suits the sensitive and emotional focus of this project. One of the key strategies to implement this would be open GitHub discussions using regular threads for users to suggest new prompts, beneficial resources, additional wellness module ideas, or any other general ideas. These discussion threads can be organized by topic (e.g., prompts, resources, accessibility) to make this feedback process more intuitive, organized, and welcoming.
I also would use CONTRIBUTIONS.md to support consistent and respectful interaction, which will also outline how to leave suggestions, report issues, and give ideas in a thoughtful way. This file could provide example formats for suggestions or details that are most useful for journal prompts or tracker feedback. I would also ensure contributors are given credit and gratitude using a public THANKS.md file to acknowledge them. This fosters a culture of appreciation in our project but also motivates others to engage with it. The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md would also ensure inclusive and respectful communication within the community, setting clear expectations for language, tone, and emotional sensitivity. This is especially important in a project like this that is centered on mental wellness. Using these ideas, I aim to create a space where everyone can contribute meaningfully while still acknowledging and respecting the emotional and personal nature of this project. 

## Sustainability Plan
To ensure the MoodOpen project is still usable in the long-term, I would firstly focus on keeping everything simple and accessible. The plaintext and markdown files should be accessible on any device, require no apps, and are easy to read and make modifications in. No apps, special programs, or additional logins would be necessary which would make the project accessible across all operating systems. This also supports long-term use as these tools will not rely on external services that could diminish over time. The modular format also contributes to sustainability. Each tool is self-contained, allowing users to pick and choose what assortment works best for them and to personalize their own mental wellness routine. This also makes it easier to maintain this project since updates can be made to individual modules without affecting the rest of the tools. This modularity encourages users to remix, expand, and use their own creativity, which allows us to design for adaptation and extend the life of the project. 
Public documentation would be maintained too to support the long-term usability and even potentially project handoff in the future. Every module includes instructions, use cases, and explanations for design rationale. The README.md would clearly guide new users and explain the structure of the toolkit. If anyone wanted to build on the project in the future, this allows them to do so while understanding its original intent before adapting it to their own needs. 
The future_ideas.md would serve as a roadmap for future growth, outlining expansion goals and to stretch any ideas for improvement. By keeping these ideas listed publicly in this file, even if they are not able to be implemented immediately, it invites other users to consider the potential for how the toolkit can look in the future. I would make sure notes about the project goals and values are included in case the project is ever passed down to someone else. These various approaches help put together a project that is simple but flexible and built to last long-term, even with the tools remaining simple and grounded. 

## Personal Reflection
Working on this project has helped me understand that open-source practices are beneficial beyond just software, and can shape emotional and creative projects, even personal ones like this. What started out as a simple idea to put together a mental health resource kit turned out to become a much deeper exploration into how structure, documentation, and interaction with the community can help support emotional wellness in a non-intrusive way. I recognized how transparency and intentional participation can also build trust without sacrificing any control, which was especially useful due to the personal and sensitive nature of this project. 
Using GitHub helped me manage all the files effectively, but it also allowed me to think critically about the purpose of each addition, different user needs, and what accountability looks like in a mental wellness space. Decisions like which contributions to accept or even smaller ones like how to phrase a prompt or respond to feedback all become much more deliberate when using a transparent and documented space. I also learned that version control and issue tracking can be used as more than just technical tools and can provide emotional clarity. 
The biggest takeaway I had was how structure and softness can exist together. Before working on this project, I felt that open source might cause a project to feel impersonal or too inflexible, but I now see that if it used in the right way it can do the opposite. By using this organized and open framework, I was able to create a project that is caring but has stability and clarity. It showed me that emotional work requires just as much thoughtful design and planning as technical work. This project became not just a toolkit for others, but a space where I can practice empathy, transparency, and collaboration in a defined way. This experience has shown me how to view project management as a means for designing for purpose and care.

## Conclusion
MoodOpen is a simple and modular mental wellness toolkit that roots from open-source project management values and strategies. The project emphasizes and embraces transparency, modularity, and guided collaboration. Using very careful curation, basic tools, and accessible infrastructure, the project is able to provide a gentle but structured, welcoming, and sustainable space for self-reflection and care. What sets this project apart is how it is able to combine emotional sensitivity with thoughtfully curated design. It does not rely on complex external tools or overwhelming features, but instead relies on the power of simplicity and routine. Each part of the project is designed for comfort to provide users a sense of grounding in their everyday lives. By utilizing open-source philosophies like public documentation, community input through discussion, and version-controlled progress, I am able to balance consistency and flexibility. These principles gave me a framework to allow the project to continuously evolve while maintaining its original vision, as well as made the project approachable and inclusive. Ultimately, the structure of this project supports users emotionally by offering space to reflect, while the process supports the project by keeping it maintainable and adaptable. This balance of softness and structure is what makes the project truly impactful.

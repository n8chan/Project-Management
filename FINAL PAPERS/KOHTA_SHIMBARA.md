# GreenRoute
Name: Kohta Shimbara </p>
Semester: Spring 2025

## Abstract
<p>
GreenRoute is an open-source computer program that enables motorists, cyclists, and transport firms to select routes that are lower in greenhouse-gas emissions without sacrificing convenience or price. The website integrates real-time traffic, elevation profile, vehicle efficiency lines, energy-grid carbon intensity, and public-charging availability to calculate the "greenest" route between point A and point B. In doing so, it completes an essential gap in the proprietary navigation tools currently on offer, which the majority of optimise for either speed or distance and reveal neither method nor data for public scrutiny. This document describes the project and more importantly, how it will be governed, made, and kept in working-open principles. Having covered the motivation for carbon-conscious routing, I then outline GreenRoute's vision, minimum viable feature set, and habits for keeping the code base, community, and funding model healthy over time. Ethical, legal, and business issues are addressed along with a lifecycle and sustainability plan to shield against maintainer burnout. The discussion shows that prudent open-source project management is as crucial as technical design in bringing a promising idea to life and making it a resilient climate-tech commons.
</p>

## Introduction and Background
<p>
  Road transport accounts for about twenty-three percent of global carbon-dioxide emissions, and urban passenger traffic accounts for most of that mode of transport. Navigation apps now impact nearly all trips, but most top platforms only optimize for the shortest distance or time. They do not always include the stop-and-go losses of congestion, the hidden energy penalty of heavy grades, or the carbon value of the power used to run an electric car at different hours of the day. When private vendors do supply an "eco route," they reveal neither the algorithm that generated it nor their source of environment data, and so researchers, cities, and end-users can't verify reported savings.
</p>
<p>
  GreenRoute can then fill this methodological void as well as power civic innovation. Experimental projects such as OpenStreetMap have shown crowdsourcing geospatial information to be feasible on planetary scale, whereas routing engines such as Valhalla demonstrate that open algorithms encourage a rich ecosystem of contributors. Complementary initiatives in green software engineering provide guidance on coding that actively minimizes emissions throughout its lifecycle (Green Software Foundation, 2024). GreenRoute would cover all; open mapping, carbon-aware computation, and participatory governance into a platform anyone can audit, extend, or integrate into regional climate policy.
</p>
<p>
  The goal of this paper has two points. First, what GreenRoute will do and why its capability is needed. Second, and more relevant to a course in project management, it outlines how the project will be handled so that a broad community can produce, maintain, and enhance the tool over time. Integrating lessons from semester class instruction on transparency, inclusive governance, and lifecycle planning, the paper tries to demonstrate that disciplined management is one of the key defining features of any successful open‑source project in itself.
</p>

## Vision and Purpose
<p>
  GreenRoute's objective is to establish carbon-aware routing as the default choice for all trips in the coming decade. In five years, the project aims to make sustainable navigation capability in at least ten large urban mobility applications and to inform three city-scale climate dashboards with real-time avoided emissions reporting. The one-year milestone is more modest but concrete: release an open application-programming interface and mobile-first web client that calculate and render the fastest, shortest, and cleanest routes for urban commuters in three cities in the United States, and estimate emissions per trip.
</p>
<p>
  The project's objective is thus environmental and educational. It works to reduce transport emissions by persuading travelers onto lower-carbon modes, yet also aims to increase public knowledge of the intangible drivers, such as regenerative braking efficiency, grid mix, height gain, that determine the real-world environmental cost of a trip. Desired effects are quantifiable carbon savings, and a highly engaged base of participants who co-develop capabilities with policy makers, fleet managers, and daily commuters. The procedure for accomplishing those outcomes relies on rapid, open iteration, peer code review, and an explicit guarantee of open participation, echoing the "transparent, participatory, collaborative, inclusive, and community‑controlled" principles.
</p>
<p>
  By defining purpose, outcome, and process beforehand, GreenRoute has a good decision-making framework; that can guide trade-offs when resource constraints, conflicting feature requests, or unforeseen ethical dilemmas arise. A well-defined story vision articulated in public documents is also a recruitment tool: volunteers and sponsors will be more drawn to a project, since long-term social value is easy to understand and personally engaging.
</p>

## Core Features and Scope
<p>
  During its first year, GreenRoute will focus on a small but critical set of features that form a minimum viable product. The site will ingest real‑time traffic speeds, elevation tiles, and road‑grade data to compute energy use by vehicle class. A model will translate those energy requirements into carbon‑dioxide equivalents using average fuel‑economy data for internal‑combustion vehicles and hourly grid‑carbon‑intensity data for electric vehicles.
</p>
<p>
  Six months down the line, the project aims to add charger‑aware routing for electric vehicles. This feature will integrate open charge‑point status feeds and battery charge simulations so that drivers can plan low‑carbon trips without risking range anxiety. Batch optimization for commercial fleets will follow, allowing a logistics coordinator to upload a list of delivery addresses and receive a schedule that minimises distance and emissions. GreenRoute also aims to offer anonymised, aggregated heat‑maps displaying the volume of carbon saved by users by the end of the initial release cycle, thereby supporting city planners who must demonstrate the effectiveness of local climate initiatives.
</p>
<p>
  It is equally important to specify what GreenRoute will not attempt to do in its first incarnation. It will not generate full voice‑led turn‑by‑turn navigation. Nor will it ingest proprietary traffic feeds that cannot be re‑distributed under an open‑database license; all dependencies must be redistributable for legal simplicity. By defining non‑goals upfront, the project protects itself against scope creep and diverts contributor energies to features which need for MVP.
</p>

## Governance and Licensing
<p>
  GreenRoute will publish all source code under the permissive MIT Licence, which maximises compatibility with commercial use while allowing enhancements to be contributed back to the commons. Data products like synthesised route‐emission pairs and aggregated heat‑maps will be published under the Open Database Licence to maintain share‑alike reciprocity for mapping data. The twin approach safeguards community‑generated datasets from the enclosure.
</p>
<p>
  In terms of governance, a five-member steering committee will direct the strategic roadmap, approve budget spending, and resolve disputes that cannot be decided by consensus. The initial maintainers will comprise the first committee, but two of the seats will be open to annual election by active contributors, so that community representation increases as the project grows. Technical direction decisions will begin as GitHub Discussions, continue as a request‑for‑comment document, and, in the absence of objections, conclude by lazy consensus after one week. In the event of consensus failure, the steering committee will cast binding votes in public meetings whose minutes are published online.
</p>
<p>
  Incident reports will be handled by a three‑person moderation panel independent from the leadership to avoid conflicts of interest. Transparency is important: after each incident, the moderators will publish a de‑identified summary of the resolution process, thereby demonstrating accountability. 
</p>

## Community Build Strategy
<p>
  Open-source projects thrive when they create welcoming and helpful communities that make it easy to enter and enjoy different kinds of contribution. GreenRoute will start by posting easily visible "good first issues" on social media hashtags where climate-tech developers hang out. Conference lightning talks and university workshops will get the site in front of GIS specialists, transportation engineers, and civic-tech activists who have useful expertise in their areas.
</p>
<p>
  Onboarding documentation needs to respect a newcomer's time, so the guide will be short, to the point, and supplemented by a five-minute screencast of how to clone the repo, install a dockerized development environment, and invoke the test suite. There will be a designated Discord server with a "first-steps" channel where seasoned maintainers rotate weekly to take questions in real time. Regular monthly community calls will alternate time zones to facilitate worldwide participation, and each release cycle will have a virtual demo day when contributors showcase new features and user stories. 
</p>
<p>
  Retention relies on important feedback loops. With every major release the project will distribute an anonymous satisfaction survey measuring perceived inclusivity, roadmap clarity, and response time to pull requests. Key health indicators such as average merge latency, and newcomer retention rate will be computed and published openly on a dashboard. Transparent self-assessment means that the project values community well-being as much as code speed, so volunteers can give their time with assurance.
</p>

## Project Management Workflow
<p>
  GreenRoute will employ a Kanban development methodology that accommodates both rapid experimentation and the asynchronous rhythms of a distributed team. Releases will be constructed over six‑week release cycles. During the first week of each cycle the committee and contributing members will plan out the roadmap in an open planning meeting, after which GitHub Milestones will be set for high-priority items. Issues will be discussed on each Monday, where maintainers will label them as bug, enhancement, documentation, research, or needs‑discussion.
</p>
<p>
  For each pull request, the contributor will run unit tests, and security scans using GitHub Actions before requesting a review. A feature cannot be committed unless it must have at least one positive review by a maintainer of the affected subsystem, and core modules require two positive reviews to keep the architecture in check. Documentation receives the most priority treatment: new endpoints require OpenAPI definitions and usage examples.
</p>
<p>
  Contributors provide short screen‑cast demos or animated GIFs which visually display their feature used at cycle closure. These artefacts occupy the release blog post and serve as living documentation for users who learn best through video. The team then documents what went well, what didn't, and what process changes to try next. The notes are published openly so everyone can benefit from the iteration. By institutionalizing transparency, the process turns every sprint into a shared learning experience, enhancing the spirit of collaboration that underlies working‑open principles.
</p>

## Lifecycle and Sustaibability Plan
<p>
  As software maintenance is more commonly a greater challenge than initial development, GreenRoute maintainers will follow semantic versioning, with odd‑numbered minor versions being reserved as development branches and even‑numbered minors as stable releases. 
</p>
<p>
Sustainability also requires monetary funding. GreenRoute will establish an Open Collective account whose public ledger records every donation and expense. Backers as individuals may contribute at any time, while corporate sponsors may pledge recurring funds in exchange for limited recognition on the project page. Also, grant support from the public sector will be a major funding way, since GreenRoute has a huge potential to contribute ecological transformation. 
</p>
<p>
  Burnout among maintainers is an existential threat to volunteer‑driven projects. To prevent it, GreenRoute will follow an "off‑call rotation" in which every core maintainer takes two consecutive weeks off from issue triage every quarter. By spreading ownership and practicing regular pruning, GreenRoute increases the likelihood that new contributors can take over leadership when old‑timers move on.
</p>

## Ethic, Legal and Social Consideration
<p>
  Privacy is the first ethical concern for any location‑based system. GreenRoute will gather telemetry only with clear opt‑in consent, and even then the data will be anonymized to trade off confidentiality with utility. GPS trace data will never be stored on the server; rather, the client will compute route segments locally and transmit only aggregated statistics.
</p>
<p>
  Because marketing divisions sometimes employ environmental claims for image-building purposes, GreenRoute must protect against being employed as a greenwashing tool. Calculation of emissions will be published in public methodology reports. Accessibility promises involve conformance to guidelines. Legally, the MIT licence describes patent permissions and this is in order to minimize legal friction
</p>

## Economic and Commercialisation Outlook
<p>
  Revenue is achievable when incentives and openness match. GreenRoute's business model is an extension of the "open‑core services" strategy that was successful for companies like Red Hat. A subscription will generate predictable revenue from delivery fleets, ride‑hailing platforms, and municipal traffic dashboards requiring guaranteed performance and availability. Large integrators also purchase consultancy packages combining custom feature development, data‑pipeline deployment, and training of personnel.
</p>
<p>
  In‑dash OEM provides a second source of revenue. Vehicles qualifying under some emissions‑reporting standards after the addition of GreenRoute may feature a "Powered by GreenRoute" badge, subject to the payment of a certification fee used to fund future upkeep. By redirecting commercial effort into the commons, the project ensures that paying clients add to, and do not dilute, the quality of the free version. 
</p>
<p>
  Financial transparency preserves trust. All funds received from hosting or consultancy will flow through the Open Collective, and the committee will publish an annual fiscal report detailing how funds were allocated. Open accounting shields against the appearance as well as the reality of capture by some corporate interest.
</p>

## Conclusion
<p>
  GreenRoute wants to make the carbon footprint as real and actionable as travel time or distance. Yet the path to such a future is dependent on more than clever algorithms: it needs governance structures that channel community excitement, development processes that scale upwards, ethical safeguards that gain the public trust, and business models that guarantee long-term viability. By making every management decision in accordance with the working‑open principles learned throughout this course—transparency, participation, inclusivity, collaboration, and community control—the project positions itself to go from a promising prototype to a worldwide public good. The technical roadmap is ambitious but realistic, and the management plan ensures that growth will not undermine openness. Building a sustainable future will require millions of small choices by visitors everywhere around the world; GreenRoute would like to make each and every one of those choices a little easier and a lot clearer. This first pull request is merely the beginning.

# Quad Day
**Rachel Chong IS340 Final Project, Spring 2025**

## Abstract  
In this paper, I will be addressing the challenges students face when entering UIUC of choosing what kind of Registered Student Organizations (RSO’s) to join and also describing my plan for an open-source mobile application. Inspired by the university’s annual Quad Day event, the app will deliver all students a filterable directory of clubs, campus events, and personalized recommendations to promote inclusivity, engagement, and retention among UIUC students. This paper will outline the mobile application Quad Day, where students will be able to view all the RSOs, view event calendars, and receive personalized recommendations to get involved on campus. The platform targets new, transfer, and current students as well as RSO leaders.

## Introduction
Getting involved on campus is one of the most impactful ways students can build community, develop leadership skills, and enhance their college experience. At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the annual club fair, Quad Day, is the main event for introducing students to the hundreds of RSOs offered on campus. However, this event only lasts for one day and can be very overwhelming, and many students tend to struggle to stay connected or discover new RSOs after the event ends until the next year. Similarly, RSO leaders face ongoing challenges in maintaining visibility and engaging with potential members throughout the academic year. 


## Purpose and Goals
The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign already has some tools to help students get involved, like the Illini Union RSO directory and the Student Affairs events calendar. However, these websites can feel outdated, hard to use, and not very helpful after Quad Day is over. Many students say they forget which clubs they liked or how to contact them later. The current platforms don’t have strong search tools, personalized suggestions, or easy ways to stay in touch with clubs. 
To address these problems, Quad Day is a mobile application that will be designed to extend that experience and opportunities of UIUC’s annual Quad Day into an accessible digital platform that can be used all year long. The app will be able to help students discover RSOs that align with their interests, stay informed about upcoming events, and connect directly with organizations. Quad Day will be open-source, made by students for students, and flexible to fit the campus’s unique needs. By combining user-centered design with open-source development principles, this project not only promotes student engagement but also encourages collaboration and innovation among the broader UIUC community. 


## Target Audience
The Quad Day app will be designed for a wide range of students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who are seeking more meaningful ways to connect with campus life. The primary audience will include first-year students who are most likely  navigating college for the first time and may feel overwhelmed by the number of opportunities available. The app will help them ease into student life by providing personalized recommendations and making it easier to find clubs that match their interests and identities. 
International students will be another key group, as they often face cultural and social barriers when trying to get involved on campus. The app can serve as a welcoming guide by helping them discover communities where they feel understood and supported. Similarly, transfer students, who join the university later in their college journey, may not have the same access to orientation events or Quad Day. The app ensures they have equal opportunities to explore RSOs and attend events throughout the year.
The platform will also be designed for current students, including juniors and seniors, who may be looking for new ways to stay involved, explore leadership roles, or expand their network before graduating. Many students want to transition from general membership into executive board positions, and the app can help them identify organizations in need of leaders or volunteers.
The app will also be a powerful tool for RSO leaders. These users need a reliable and centralized way to manage their presence, promote events, recruit new members, and engage with their audience. The app will reduce the need for disjointed communication channels like email chains or hard-to-manage social media pages by giving RSOs a consistent and organized digital space to interact with students.


## Key Features
The Quad Day app will include several key features designed to make campus involvement easier and more accessible. 
The ExploreTab will allow students to search and filter RSOs by category, name, or popularity, helping them quickly find organizations that match their interests. 
The Calendar Tab will display upcoming campus-wide RSO events in a personalized shared calendar, making it simple to stay updated on what’s happening around campus. Students can also get reminders for events so they don’t miss out.
The app will also offer Personalized Recommendations based on a student’s interests, helping them discover new RSOs they might not have found otherwise. It can also suggest clubs and events based on a student’s interests and activity within the app. 
For RSO leaders, the Admin Panel can provide tools to manage their organization’s page, post updates, and add events, making it easier to reach and engage with potential members throughout the year.

## Challenges and Risks
The Quad Day app aims to enhance student engagement through thoughtful design and open-source collaboration, however, there will be challenges throughout the process. One issue includes maintaining accurate and up-to-date RSO information. Outdated event listings can reduce trust and limit student involvement. To manage this, the app will include regular update reminders for RSOs, along with options for users to report outdated or incorrect content. This will allow the application to continue to thrive and receive up to date feedback and information so it can be a resource students can rely on. 
Another challenge can be handling conflict in the open-source community. Conflict can seem like a bad thing, but it does show that people care and bring different ideas to the table. However, it’s still important to manage it in a healthy way. The project will create a friendly space with clear rules, good communication, and respectful discussions. This way, disagreements can lead to better ideas and teamwork instead of problems.
Lastly, ensuring a consistent user experience can be difficult when contributions come from many developers. To prevent a fragmented design, the team will maintain strong design systems, use consistent user feedback, and enforce a shared vision. As noted in the article, cultivating thick skin and separating critiques of ideas from personal criticism will be essential for a healthy collaborative space.

## Open Source Approach
Using an open-source approach to build the Quad Day app can help bring the UIUC community together by encouraging different people to share their ideas and skills. This means the app can grow and improve quickly, with new features added by students, RSOs, or developers who understand campus life. It’s also a cost-effective option, since it doesn’t require a large budget for development. Open-source projects can also lead to quicker innovation because many people are working on the same thing at once, solving problems and updating the app based on real feedback.
Since anyone is able to see and access the app’s code, it can also help to build trust. Students will know their data is protected, and developers can easily spot and fix bugs or security issues. This makes the app more reliable and safe, especially when handling important student information. Open-source projects also tend to reach more users, since they’re easy to share and improve. More students and RSOs will hear about the app and want to use it, making it a useful tool for everyone.
Students can also get involved in shaping the app to fit their needs. Whether they’re coders, designers, or just passionate about improving campus life, their contributions help the app reflect what real students want. RSOs can promote their clubs directly in the app, helping them grow and stay connected. As more people join and help, the app becomes a shared space that belongs to the whole community. This support helps keep the app alive and useful for future students too.

## Data Privacy and Security
Protecting student data is essential for building trust in the Quad Day app. The project will prioritize strong privacy measures to ensure that personal information, such as user preferences and activity, is securely stored and only used with consent. The open-source nature of the app allows for transparency in how data is handled, and regular security audits by the community will help identify and fix vulnerabilities quickly. Additionally, the app will comply with university policies and legal regulations regarding data protection. By safeguarding student privacy, the app encourages more users to engage confidently, knowing their information is respected and secure.

## Conclusion
The Quad Day app aims to enhance student engagement at UIUC by extending the annual club fair into a year-round, accessible platform. By leveraging an open-source approach, the app will benefit from diverse contributions, faster innovation, and increased transparency, all while remaining cost-effective. The focus on community collaboration and student participation will help create a tool that truly meets the needs of students and RSOs alike. Ultimately, this project seeks to build a stronger, more connected campus community where students can easily discover, join, and stay involved with organizations that matter to them.

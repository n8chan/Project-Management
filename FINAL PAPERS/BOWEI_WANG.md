**Introduction**

Financial literacy is an important life skill since it allows people to save, spend, borrow, and invest wisely. Nonetheless, research consistently shows that young people enter college and the workforce with little understanding of basic financial concepts. According to the Council for Economic Education (2021), just 20% of high schools in the United States require a particular personal finance course, so the majority of pupils are prepared to manage actual money. Recognizing this need, I conceived MoneyWise: Financial Literacy for Young Adults as an open-source, community-driven mobile and online platform that teaches financial concepts through interactive modules and allows users to extend, alter, and submit new learning resources.
MoneyWise was inspired by my freshman year at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, when I observed classmates struggle to create a simple monthly budget or understand the impact of compounding interest on their student loans. Instead of viewing personal finance as a fundamental skill, traditional schools could treat it as an afterthought, swiftly included into economics classes or offered as an elective. In contrast, proprietary budgeting applications dominate the market; they typically function as black boxes into which users enter personal data while remaining unaware of the assumptions underlying debt payback programs, savings estimates, or expenditure alerts. MoneyWise addresses both deficiencies by combining pedagogically competent content (created in collaboration with specialists from the School of Information Sciences) with a completely open codebase that encourages community review and input.
MoneyWise blends simple React and React Native frontends with a modular learning engine written in Node.js and TypeScript. A plugin module allows the community to update, amend, or improve papers on any financial topic, from the fundamentals of budgeting to the mechanics of credit ratings to the basics of investing. This architectural approach, which incorporates best practices in software engineering, ensures that the platform can be swiftly updated to include the most recent research in behavioral economics and financial education (Lusardi & Mitchell, 2014). MoneyWise makes personal financial education more accessible by hosting all papers, design arguments, and roadmaps on GitHub. It also serves as a real laboratory for students to explore open-source development, collaborative governance, and continuous integration/deployment procedures.
Furthermore, MoneyWise fosters a robust ecosystem of peer and alumni mentors who offer live lectures on topics such as tax filing, credit card management, and retirement planning, both online and in-person. A Discord workspace and an Airtable-powered alumni directory supplement these sessions by allowing guests to network, share personal success stories, and provide targeted feedback on product development. MoneyWise aims to bridge the gap between formal education and long-term financial well-being through a combination of structured, research-backed courses and pragmatic, community-driven support, ensuring that every young adult graduates not only with a diploma but also with the confidence and capacity to control their financial future.

**Purpose**

MoneyWise's primary purpose is to eliminate the present financial literacy gap among young adults by providing an open-source, adaptable platform that teaches essential money-management skills while allowing users to directly influence its development. When it does exist, traditional personal finance education is typically compartmentalized in elective courses or buried within more general economics courses, resulting in low engagement and retention of critical concepts such as budgeting, credit management, and investment fundamentals (Council for Economic Education, 2021). MoneyWise fills this gap by providing interactive learning modules co-developed with professors in the School of Information Sciences and packaged as distinct, community-maintained plugins. This ensures that the material is up to date with best practices from behavioral economics and pedagogical research.
MoneyWise thinks that by opening up its whole codebase and governance mechanisms, clients would be empowered beyond tangible delivery. Contributors ranging from students to alumni can suggest new modules, improve existing ones, or localize information for other audiences, mirroring the collaborative procedures observed in professional open-source initiatives. This participative technique not only increases the platform's versatility, but also gives students hands-on experience with API design, version control, and continuous integration/deployment workflows.
Finally, MoneyWise intends to create a stimulating peer and mentor network that spreads information beyond the screen. Integrated technologies, such as a real-time Discord community and an Airtable-powered searchable alumni database, enable users to communicate with near-peer mentors, attend live seminars on topics like as tax preparation or debt-reduction strategies, and share personal finance successes. MoneyWise aims to provide every young adult with the confidence, knowledge, and cooperative attitude needed to determine their financial future by combining free, research-backed training tools with practical community involvement.

**Target Audience**

MoneyWise is primarily aimed at college students and recent graduates navigating the transition from academic life to financial independence. Despite demonstrating strong theoretical knowledge, studies show that young people frequently lack confidence in managing daily financial tasks such as budgeting, saving, and investing (Lusardi & Mitchell, 2014). MoneyWise targets 18- to 25-year-olds attending two- and four-year colleges, meeting them at a critical juncture when their financial habits are still developing and timely assistance may have a lasting impact.
The primary audience in this diverse group is undergraduates majoring in subjects with specific application and recruiting deadlines, such as business, engineering, information sciences, and economics. These students benefit from tailored classes on internship season budgeting, student loan repayment strategies, and graduate school application costs. Engineering students, for example, would need exact cash-flow estimates to balance living expenses during unpaid internships, whereas business students typically seek specific assistance on how to handle signing bonuses (Council for Economic Education, 2021).
MoneyWise also benefits first-generation and minority students, who, according to studies, are less likely to seek family financial assistance or create professional networks (Smith and Hernandez, 2022). Through mentor matching and an alumni directory, the platform fosters equitable access to job opportunities and reduces barriers to insider information. For these groups, live peer-led seminars on credit score improvement or salary negotiation are especially effective because they increase financial literacy and a sense of belonging, all of which correlate with higher student happiness.
The second group, which consists of graduate students and early-career professionals, particularly those pursuing master's or doctoral degrees, needs advanced financial planning tools to manage stipends, research funds, and postdoctoral migration. These users can utilize MoneyWise to simulate complex scenarios such as conference trip planning and retirement account contributions, as well as create specific plugin modules to benefit the greater community.
MoneyWise's initial deployment targets institutions in cities and suburbs, where living costs and financial needs may be higher. However, the platform's open-source nature allows for community-contributed data sets and regional expense calculators to be quickly adapted to diverse cost-of-living scenarios. The early adaptation design ensures that MoneyWise is equally relevant to both national and international users.
Finally, MoneyWise attracts professors and campus professionals such as academic counselors, career center staff, and academics who wish to include financial literacy into their classes and extracurricular activities. The platform's open codebase and plugin design contribute to the project's growth and impact by allowing educators to integrate specific modules into course management systems or run campus-wide financial wellness initiatives.
MoneyWise aims to provide all young adults with the tools and networks they need for long-term financial well-being through customizable, community-driven content and mentoring methods that meet the specific needs of each group. This includes early-career professionals, graduate students, first-generation and underrepresented students, traditional undergraduates, and MoneyWise's target audience.

**Plan and Strategy Outline**

Phase 1: Pilot and Validation (Months 1–4).
Working with two departments, Information Sciences and Business, we will assist in recruiting 150 volunteer students (75 from each department) for an early-access program during the trial phase. These students will evaluate the key mobile and web applications, take basic financial literacy classes (budgeting foundations, debt management methods, and introductory investing), and complete biweekly surveys (Lusardi & Mitchell, 2014). We will simultaneously provide a Slack workspace and a private Airtable alumni database, allowing pilot participants to communicate with four near-peer mentors each. Five upperclassmen in a small "Mentor Corps" will be trained in career center best practices for supervising weekly office hours. Pilot success criteria include at least 50 mentor-mentee matches within the first two months, an average satisfaction rating of four out of five, and module completion rates of greater than 60%.

Phase 2: Expansion and Iteration (5-10 months).
Once fundamental features are demonstrated, MoneyWise will be expanded to include four other departments—Engineering, Economics, Liberal Arts & Sciences, and Fine & Applied Arts—bringing the total number of users to 500. During this phase, community members can submit new modules (such as tax-filing simulations or graduate-school application strategies) via GitHub pull requests, allowing the plugin ecosystem to remain open. Every submission is peer reviewed by at least two maintainers, who then run automated tests in our continuous integration system. We will provide basic analytics dashboards that track module usage, Slack activity, and Airtable connection requests to help with data-driven decision making. Monthly Zoom-hosted "Feedback Forums" will focus on qualitative observations once summary findings are given to increase transparency.

Phase 3: Institutionalization and Sustainability (Months 11+).
In the final stage, MoneyWise seeks official authorization from the university's Academic Affairs and Career Center. To ensure curriculum integration, we advocate incorporating platform modules into existing first-year seminar courses and senior capstone projects. A small Student Steering Council, chosen each semester, will oversee new feature prioritization, guest-speaker honoraria distribution, and mentorship expansion in accordance with open-government best practices. Charity donations from alumni networks, as well as a modest university grant (around the cost of one full-time equivalent staff member), can help ensure financial sustainability. Regular audits of platform usage, user satisfaction, and learning outcomes—for example, increased budget-planning confidence as measured by pre- and post-tests—will guide iterative improvements, closing the loop on the MoneyWise approach and confirming its function as a permanent, student-driven tool for financial empowerment.

Community and Values**

MoneyWise's architecture and community culture are shaped by three core concepts: cooperation, accessibility, and mentorship. Every student, whether seasoned contributor or novice, has the opportunity to shape MoneyWise's products and services through collaborative efforts. Hosting all code, design documentation, and roadmaps on GitHub allows us to create an environment in which anybody can access pull requests, issue discussions, and roadmap recommendations, promoting a meritocratic process in which community evaluation promotes the best ideas (Layton et al., 2020). Regular "Sprint Showcases" allow users to try new modules, from interactive debt-payoff calculators to regional budgeting guides, and provide feedback, enabling shared ownership and ongoing development.
Accessibility inspires us to remove barriers that prevent students from fully engaging with MoneyWise. Materials, including slide decks, interactive demos, and transcripts, are made accessible under a permissive open-source license; all key modules and community events are free. To accommodate persons with varying abilities, the platform's user interface adheres to WCAG 2.1 AA requirements such as semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, and customizable text sizes. Our translation initiative also invites volunteers to translate resources into many languages, ensuring their relevance for international students and encouraging inclusivity across cultural boundaries. MoneyWise reflects the notion that everyone should have access to financial education by making technology accessible and offering free, open licenses.
Mentoring represents the third pillar of our community concept. According to data-driven research, coordinated mentorship significantly enhances students' career-search self-efficacy and job-readiness (Hamilton, 2019). MoneyWise's Mentor Match program connects upperclassmen and alumni mentors with younger members based on shared career goals, allowing for biweekly one-on-one meetings that cover résumé review, mock interviews, and specialized financial planning. Aside from personal mentoring, the network hosts monthly "FinChat" panels with graduates from fields such as consulting, technology, and nonprofit management to share practical knowledge and answer student questions. Students can access MoneyWise's interactive courses through a layered support system that includes these panels and peer-led seminars on topics like tax filing and credit score optimization.
The community is intended to support these principles. Every semester, active contributors join a Steering Council to supervise strategic goals, approve new plugin requests, and disburse speaker honoraria and platform upgrade monies. From introducing a new core dependency to expanding event options, public GitHub discussions and anonymous polls ensure transparency and widespread participation in all major decisions. While Zoom "Office Hours" provide live coding assistance and financial Q&A sessions, Slack and Discord channels enable asynchronous support. MoneyWise fosters a healthy ecosystem in which all students, regardless of experience or knowledge, can learn, contribute, and thrive in their financial journey.

**Conclusion**

MoneyWise brings a new viewpoint to financial literacy education by incorporating open-source software methodologies, evidence-based pedagogy, and community-driven assistance. MoneyWise has always prioritized transparency, exposing all code, design presentations, and roadmaps on GitHub so that students not only learn basic money management skills but also gain real-world experience with collaborative software development. By breaking down information into plugins, the platform remains agile by allowing contributors to update or improve modules on budgeting, credit control, and investment in response to user feedback and new behavioral economics research.
Importantly, MoneyWise's success is dependent on its active community, which embodies the ideals of collaboration, accessibility, and mentoring. Pilot studies have found that pairing upperclassmen and alumni mentors with younger students significantly boosts confidence in job searches and financial planning. Following accessibility criteria ensures that all young adults, regardless of background or ability, can benefit from the platform's resources under a free, open license. MoneyWise emphasizes ownership and belonging through a democratically chosen Steering Council, real-time networking links, and organized seminars, resulting in continual engagement and progress.
Moving forward, MoneyWise's institutional adoption by university career centers and academic programs will solidify its basis for student development. Including MoneyWise modules in first-year seminars and capstone courses would help to establish proactive financial planning and open-source collaboration as essential skills. Finally, MoneyWise aspires to provide every generation of young people with not just the tools to confidently manage their money, but also the collaborative abilities to support and steer innovations that improve financial well-being for everybody.

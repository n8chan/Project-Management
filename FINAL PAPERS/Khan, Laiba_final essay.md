### Abstract

Style Finder is an open‑source web platform that simplifies personal style discovery for Gen Z and millennial users. By guiding individuals through a easy to navigate quiz on color preferences, body shape, and lifestyle factors, the system produces tailored outfit recommendations that reduce decision fatigue and minimize fashion waste. A dynamic “Trending Now” feed driven by real‑time trend data and community upvotes and discussions ensures recommendations remain both fresh and relevant. Integrated sizing guides, styling articles, and moderated discussion boards create a supportive environment where users share advice and vote on best solutions. Partnerships with sustainable brands and ethical influencers reinforce the platform’s commitment to conscious consumerism and community engagement.(McNeill & Venter, 2019; Smith & Kim, 2023)

#### Introduction

Fast‑fashion culture and overwhelming online shops and trends often leave shoppers frustrated, contributing to high return rates and excess waste as the trends die off and people want to move on to the next. Research shows that nearly 30 percent of purchased clothing is returned, generating significant environmental impact and consumer dissatisfaction (McNeill & Venter, 2019). Traditional e‑commerce sites typically use generic recommendation engines that overlook individual preferences, resulting in low engagement and wasted purchases. Additionally, consumers are not able to catch the trends before they happen, which leads to them only being able to enjoy the piece of clothing for a limited amount of time.

To address these challenges, StyleFinder uses a quiz that captures a user’s unique profile—such as preferred color palette, body silhouette, and daily routine and maps these inputs to a curated selection of outfits (Smith & Kim, 2023). As users and influencers upvote looks and share styling tips, the recommendation engine adapts, blending algorithmic suggestions with human curation to balance trendiness and timeless style.

By adopting an open‑source development model, Style Finder invites collaboration from developers, UX designers, micro‑influencers, and sustainable brands (Fogel, 2005). This transparency fosters trust around sponsored content and empowers contributors to propose new features, refine algorithms, and expand community‑driven resources. 

#### Key Features and Community Collaboration

Style Finder’s personalization begins with a multi‑step quiz that captures core style dimensions. The backend matches responses against a database of ethically sourced brands and curated collections, generating a custom “Look Book” for each user. A “Trending Now” section leverages both API‑fetched social media trend data and user upvotes to surface rising styles in real time.

Additional resources such as quick links to comprehensive sizing guides, blog posts on styling tips, and video tutorials are integrated directly into the dashboard to support informed purchasing decisions. These features work together to reduce returns and encourage sustainable consumption by guiding users toward well fitting, versatile pieces (McNeill & Venter, 2019).

#### Community Collaboration
Hosting the code on GitHub under an open‑source license ensures that anyone can inspect, fork, and contribute to Style Finder. Contributors follow a clear workflow: issues capture user requests or bug reports; pull requests propose code changes; automated tests validate functionality; and peer reviews maintain code quality. Micro‑influencers and ethical brands participate by curating capsule collections and offering exclusive style advice. Meanwhile, volunteer “style helpers” moderate discussion boards, answer newcomer questions, and highlight best practices. This collaborative ecosystem enables rapid iteration on features such as adding new quiz questions, importing additional trend feeds, or improving accessibility while preserving the platform’s ethical focus (Fogel, 2005; Smith & Kim, 2023).

Beyond code, community members cocreate marketing assets, write guest blog posts, and organize virtual styling workshops. These activities not only drive user engagement but also reinforce the values of mindful consumption and shared ownership. As the contributor base grows, Style Finder evolves organically, reflecting real‑world style shifts and user needs.

### Conclusion

Style Finder demonstrates how a focused personalization workflow, combined with transparent open‑source collaboration and ethical partnerships, can transform the online shopping experience for young consumers. By aligning algorithmic recommendations with community feedback, the platform delivers relevant, sustainable style advice that reduces return rates and supports conscious purchasing. Its modular design and contributor driven roadmap ensure ongoing adaptability whether integrating augmented reality try ons, scaling to microservices for peak demand, or expanding brand partnerships. Ultimately, Style Finder fosters a vibrant, supportive community where users not only discover their best looks but also participate in shaping a more sustainable fashion ecosystem.

# Open-Source Resource for Shaping AI Policies in Secondary Education

## Introduction
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project focuses on building an open-source website that supports a collaborative community for developing AI policies for high schools. As AI tools become increasingly accessible and widely used by students, the absence of AI policies in secondary education could cause serious risks. Students might overuse or misuse AI tools without guidelines which could lower the quality of their learning and weaken their ability to think independently. In schools with stricter rules, students might miss the chance to practice using AI tools more efficiently and responsible before entering college. To solve this, the website will collect and test different AI policies and turn them into useful resources for teachers, school leaders, and others who make decisions in education to construct comprehensive AI policies that fits their school the best. The goal is to help students use AI safely, fairly, and effectively. The website will be built using GitHub and open to everyone, so it’s transparent that allows anyone from the education or tech community to contribute. All finished policies will be shared publicly through the website so that schools and teachers can have free access to them. A Discord community will also be built for educators, students, AI experts and researchers to share their thoughts and communicate in organized channels. They will be testing out policies in real classrooms, sharing feedback, and improving the implementation of AI policies as a group. This way, the policies are not only written from theory but also shaped by real life use and open conversation. The project brings people together to make sure students learn how to use AI in the right way.

## Purpose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During a meeting with high school teachers and school board members, they expressed both hope and concern regarding the use of AI in classrooms. They see the power of using AI as a learning tool that is necessary for students to master as they prepare to enter college and later on society, especially in the technology fields. They believe that AI can build the bridge between creativity and practicality to help students to bring their ideas to real life even when they lack professional level skills. At the same time, they are concerned that overusing AI tools in high school could harm students’ critical thinking ability and development of self-awareness. Over-reliance on AI tools at this stage could hold students’ back from forming their own reasoning and decision-making skills which are essential for college and life beyond.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the AI industry existed for many years, it is only in recent times that AI tools have been widely deployed for everyday public use. The rapid growth in user demand has driven AI companies to evolve and upgrade their products at an unprecedented pace which created the gap of comprehensive AI policies. Currently, most publicly available AI policies focus on two areas which are policies for restricting AI companies due to ethical and privacy concerns, and university guidelines that regulate how students should use AI tools in academic settings. For this project, we plan to fill in the gap of secondary education AI policies by drawing policies from both of these existing models to create an initial set of guidelines specifically targeting secondary education. These policies will then be implemented in school environments and evaluated through testing to assess their effectiveness, relevance, and impact. This approach ensures that the policies are both grounded in established practices and adapted to the unique context of high school education. Zoom in from the large scope of AI policies, a recent academic article “A comprehensive AI policy education framework for university teaching and learning” by Cecilia Ka Yuk Chan identified ten key domains for AI policy as academic misconduct, governance, monitoring, fairness, attribution, training, assessment, balance, workplace readiness, and holistic competencies (Chan, 2023). These domains will guide the classification of the high school policies and be published on the website with free access to all stakeholders in secondary education. 

## Project Vision
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An open canvas form was conducted to set the scope and vision for the project including definition of both product and community. The product will be the final delivery of the website containing all policies and project information, while the community will operate through GitHub and Discord platforms where multidisciplinary experts can communicate and exchange thoughts. The project addresses the absence of effective and comprehensive AI policies in secondary education. The key problem that the product aims to resolve is the gap of effective and comprehensive AI policies in secondary education. The solution to this problem is to create a website containing all the finalized policies and keep the website accessible for everyone, organized and easy to navigate to find desired information, and sustainable with up-to-date policies for long-term use. There are a few key metrics that will be used to evaluate the success and effectiveness of the final delivery of the website, including user usage, which reflects how frequently and consistently the platform is accessed; engagement rate, which measures how actively users interact with the site's content and features; and policy adoption rate, which indicates how widely the published AI policies are being implemented by secondary schools and educators in real-world settings. In order for the website to contain quality information, resources like expert contributors from both education and technology fields and technology software are required. To support the project, a team of contributors with expertise in areas such as web development, website maintenance, data analysis, user interface and user experience design, public policy, AI development, and school administration will be required. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving on to the community side, we aim to build platforms on GitHub and Discord to bridge the communication between experts from different fields who have the same interest in publication of AI policies. The primary user profiles for the project will include the entire secondary school system with a focus on educators, school administrators, and students. To increase visibility and attract a broader audience, social media channels will be launched on platforms such as Instagram and YouTube where updates, educational content, and community highlights will be regularly shared to engage users and raise awareness about the project.


## Workflow and Timeline
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project has five phases which are initiation, community and engagement, research and policy development, web development, and end with ongoing monitoring with a 14 weeks timeline. This workflow is designed to support the development and deployment of the open-source AI policies for secondary education projects.

## Project Management Strategies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project adopts a flexible, transparent, and collaborative project management strategy by using Agile methodology to support continuous improvement and real-time feedback. To begin, the initiative launches with a sprint structure. Each sprint cycle focuses on a single policy unit from concept to draft through testing and real-world implementation in school environments. This allows teams to quickly identify challenges, gather feedback from students and educators, and iterate on solutions. Rather than creating policies as a one time task, this method enables constant evaluation and revision to ensure that each policy remains responsive to the evolving educational needs and technology trends.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to avoid top-down control in this form of collaboration, scrum roles will be used to distribute authority. There will be a policy owner who serves as the leader for a specific policy area to set clear goals and maintain focus for the team. The scrum master supports the team by ensuring agile principles are followed, facilitating collaboration, removing barriers, and aligning tasks with project milestones. Team members contribute in specialized capacities, particularly within the data analysis pipeline, where they are responsible for processing research findings, student feedback, and implementation metrics. This structure not only improves accountability but also enables clear division of tasks and smoother iteration cycles. Moreover, to support policy development and resolve differences in opinion, the project will also incorporate the use of argument maps. These visual tools will help structure complex debates, clarify differing viewpoints, and ensure that decisions about new policies are made through transparent and reasoned communication.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project will also use an open mentorship model which encourages broad community participation and community sustainability. New contributors like students, educators, and developers are welcomed to begin with small tasks such as suggesting edits, flagging usability concerns, or participating in discussion on Discord. Over time, these contributors can grow into more substantial and core roles such as drafting policy or leading new sprint cycles. This model reduces barriers to entry and enforces shared ownership by learning within the community.


## Discord Community
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Discord community is designed as the central hub for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and policy co-creation. The members in the community will be structured into three sections which are the core project contributors, the open-source community, and the large community. As the community grows, a discourse trust system could be implemented to manage participation levels and reward active contributors. Considering both community structures, a framework containing three sections of channels along with a service guide that outlines community guidelines is built into the Discord server. The three sections are information, community, and core contributors, and each section includes channels for more detailed discussion topics.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The information section welcomes new contributors who join the community with an introduction channel for onboarding and an announcement channel for updates and public event notifications. Following that is the community section, built for the open-source community, which includes a general discussion channel, a new policy channel, a current policies and feedback channel, and a chatbot for answering FAQs. Moving on to the core contributor channel, which is designed for the project leaders to address broader issues, it contains a web development channel, a GitHub channel, an advertising channel, and a fund channel. In the community section, people will coordinate asynchronously, while the core contributors might need synchronous meetings to ensure alignment on the overall direction of the project. The transparent structure ensures the Discord community to be inclusive, sustainable, and well governed to support both agile development cycles and long-term growth. 


## GitHub Repository
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The GitHub repository serves as the backbone of the project’s technical infrastructure to support transparency, collaboration, and version control. It is organized with a clear folder structure where each policy will have its own folder containing documentation, raw data files, data analysis file, and final draft of policies. Foundational files such as README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md will be provided to the contributors with essential onboarding information and community guidelines. A Kanban board will be used to track contributions, manage task flow, and visually organize work into stages like “To Do,” “In Progress,” “Review,” and “Done.” This system ensures that every team member understands the current status of tasks and what’s needed next. Roles are clearly defined between repository maintainers and contributors to streamline collaboration. Each policy is treated as a complete workflow, with folders storing data acquisition results, statistical tests, draft iterations, and final versions. Milestones are tracked using CHANGELOG.md within each policy unit to ensure accountability and highlight progress over time. The GitHub setup not only supports open development but also enables reproducible research, structured documentation, and long-term maintainability of AI policies in education.

## Website Features
Link to the website: https://dandelion-circle-yl75.squarespace.com

Password: 1

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The website serves as the delivery of the project to the public which is designed to provide easy access to policies, community resources, and contributor tools. The site features an announcement banner for timely updates and a header that links directly to the project’s GitHub, Discord, and social media pages. Central to the site is the policies page where the finalized policies are organized in different categories for easy exploration. The navigation bar includes key sections such as meet the team, feedback, donation, and FAQs enabling users to connect with contributors, share their experiences, and support the project. A “contribute a policy” button encourages visitors to submit ideas and drafts for making new policies. The website also includes a footer with terms of service to establish transparency and trust. Overall, the platform is built to grow with the community and support inclusive, real-time collaboration.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To test the key metrics for the project, data from the backend will be used to track visibility, engagement, adoption, and community involvement. Metrics such as the number of visitors, page views, document downloads, and time spent on pages will help evaluate user reach and interaction. Moreover, feedback submissions and click-through rates will indicate how users navigate and respond to the content. Together, these metrics will guide the ongoing improvement of the website and ensure that it remains as a valuable resource for educators and policy makers.


## Maintenance and Monitoring
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintenance and monitoring are essential to keeping the project sustainable, up-to-date, and trustworthy over time. There will be regular meetings held to review the policies, update tools and documents, and respond to changes in technology and user needs. The GitHub repository tracks version history through changelogs and commits which makes every update transparent. On the Discord server, community feedback is actively collected through discussion in channels, feedback forms, and periodic review sessions. These host reviews act like an agile retrospective where contributors can reflect on what’s working, what isn’t, and possible improvements for the next cycle. Automated systems like bots can also be implemented to remind contributors of inactive issues or dashboards that track engagement and pull request activity. In order to keep the community active, an open mentorship model will be adopted to encourage new contributors to join, learn, and gradually take on more substantial roles within the community. This not only supports the growth of the contributor base but also helps preserve institutional knowledge and share ownership. Several key metrics are used to evaluate project health which are the community engagement rate, policy relevance, activity in documentation updates, and the average time taken to resolve issues. By consistently tracking these indicators, the team can respond to emerging challenges to improve user experience and maintain the quality of both policies and technical infrastructure.

## Conclusion
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the AI policy project offers a collaborative approach to addressing the urgent need for clear, adaptable, and inclusive AI policies in secondary education. By combining open-source development with active community, the project ensures that policies are not only based on expert knowledge but also grounded in the classrooms. The use of both Discord and GitHub provide platforms for professionals from multidisciplinary fields to gather together to publish the AI policies that best fit for secondary education. The structured workflow, agile management, and monitoring system allows the project to continuously develop and refine to match the rapid growth of AI. We aim to keep the project accessible, relevant, and accurate.

**Abstract** 

The hypothetical open-source project I am presenting is Campuscribs. Campuscribs is the premier open-source subletting platform designed specifically for college communities, changing how students and young renters find, list, and manage short-term housing opportunities on college campuses. Built as a full-stack web application with Node.js, TypeScript, and React, Campuscribs offers a powerful, modern , and student-friendly foundation for finding housing tailored to the subletting culture of university housing systems. Campuscribs provides an amazing platform where students can post sublets, search for subletting options near campus, communicate securely with potential tenants, and manage their listings. This would all from a responsive user interface on the web. Ultimately, Campuscribs is spearheading a broader movement which is represented by **my vision statement: Campuscribs is democratizing access to affordable, flexible short-term student housing.** By remaining fully open-source and actively fostering a collaborative development community, it empowers universities, students , and independent developers to customize, extend, and deploy Campuscribs instances based on local needs, customized on college, housing type or anything else. Campuscribs can be the first of many open and powerful innovations in one of the most entrenched and difficult markets of housing. 




**Introduction + Background**

The idea for Campuscribs was formed from a personal struggle with the problem of student housing. During the summer of my freshman year for an internship, finding housing on or near campus became an unexpectedly chaotic and frustrating experience. I had two options. The first was trying to reach out to my personal network and hope someone had an apartment to sublet from . Meanwhile many of the leasing companies would intentionally mislead me about open sublets, or opt to charge me for extravagant fees for their available sublet listings. The final option was to navigate an unreliable and fragmented network of ad-hoc listings shared on social media platforms like Snapchat stories, Facebook groups, and poorly maintained third-party websites. 

This informal system posed major problems. Subletting posts were hard to track, easy to miss, and lacked key information like pricing, lease terms, room availability, or even basic safety assurances. Communication was decentralized, verification was nonexistent, and I often had no good way to search, filter, or compare listings. Every post I saw felt like a huge risk I was taking for something that was important as finding subletting for the summer. As I saw the need for flexible, short term housing continued to grow for my friends and peers, especially during off-peak periods like summer internships, study abroad programs, or semester-long exchanges throughout my college times, it became very clear that the existing methods simply could not keep up. 

However, this struggle was not unique to my campus. Across universities nationwide, students face similar challenges year after year: fragmented information, disorganized communication, and limited access to reliable housing resources, especially for short term subletting. What was needed was a modern, centralized, and easy-to-use platform. This would be something that could bring the simplicity and reliability of real estate platforms like Zillow into the student subletting space, but tailored for the specific needs of college communities.

Ultimately, this is the core vision of **Campuscribs**. It is a full-stack web application built with Node.js, TypeScript, and React, designed from the ground up to provide a seamless, transparent, and trustworthy experience for students seeking or offering sublets. Campuscribs not only organizes listings in an intuitive, searchable interface, but also empowers users to post, manage, and communicate securely which would all be accessible within a single platform. It represents a step toward modernizing student housing, making it accessible, safe, and community-driven through open-source technology in a centralized place. 

**Project Design, Development, and Strategy** 

_**Project Design**_

The design of **Campuscribs** would follow a phased approach to building a platform that meets real student housing needs while staying manageable for a small to medium sized open-source team. Instead of attempting to build a full marketplace immediately, I’d like to plan a product rollout is planned across three clearly scoped phases, each with well-defined deliverables (Clinton) . I would ideally like to accomplish each phase in 8-10 weeks, for a total project length of 24-30 weeks based on best practices for a medium-length software development project (Shealy). These timelines may be adjustable based on the number of open-source contributors that contribute, their skill, and any unexpected issue we run into as me and the open source team builds the project. 

First, phase 1 (weeks 1-8) would be focusing on building a simple, usable core. This core would include a web platform where students can post subletting listings, search for available sublets, and directly message other users. The emphasis will be on basic listing management, secure authentication, simple filtering by location and date, and reliable user-to-user communication. Phase 1 aims to solve the immediate pain of fragmented social media postings by offering a centralized, clean alternative. 

Next, phase 2  (weeks 9-16) will introduce improvements based on early user feedback. Planned enhancements include more advanced search filters (such as price range and amenities), listing photos and media handling, profile customization, and a simple user dashboard to manage active listings. Admin tools to moderate listings and handle flagged content will also be introduced in this phase and scalability with technical infrastructure will be considered depending on the growth of the project. 

Finally, Phase 3  (weeks 17-24) will expand Campuscribs into a more mature housing marketplace experience. This would include ML-based subletting post recommendations, roommate matching for sublets based on preferences, verified listing badges for trusted sublets, and partnerships with university organizations for broader reach. This phase will also introduce performance optimizations to support higher traffic and heavier listing activity. We would finally then probably use this phase as an opportunity to support multiple universities, currencies, and languages experimentally to see if Campuscribs can have a national or international impact.  Each phase is designed to build progressively while maintaining a usable product at every stage. Early launches are prioritized over perfect feature sets, and features will be driven by real-world feedback rather than assumptions. This phased rollout ensures that Campuscribs can stay grounded in user needs, avoid overengineering, and deliver value from the very first public version .





_**Project Development**_

The technical setup of Campuscribs is built with a focus on reliability and scalability. From the earliest stages of development, the goal was to create an environment where both contributors and users could easily understand, modify, and extend the system. Clean organization, clear documentation, and a strong workflow around contributions are super important to this project in order to make sure it completes on time and is effective for many people to use at once.  

I wanted to use React for the frontend framework based on its strong reputation for building fast, responsive, and modular user interfaces. React’s component-based architecture allows the UI to be broken down into reusable, isolated pieces that are easy to develop, test, and maintain. Features such as client-side routing with React Router and local state management through React Context/Redux provide a flexible way to build a smooth user experience across pages like listings, profiles, dashboards, and messaging interfaces. Additionally, React’s large ecosystem of libraries and strong community support ensure that the platform can easily evolve with modern best practices without being locked into a rigid framework.

On the backend, Node.js combined with TypeScript and Express.js was chosen for its lightweight, high-performance server-side capabilities and its developer-friendly environment. Node.js enables asynchronous, non-blocking I/O operations, making it well-suited for handling multiple concurrent users. This is definitely super important for a dynamic platform where students will be browsing and posting listings in real-time. Using TypeScript on the server introduces strong typing, better tooling, and early error detection, leading to more robust, maintainable backend code. Express.js as an API routing library provides the flexibility to structure the API cleanly around RESTful principles while remaining easy to extend with middleware and additional services like authentication, validation, and error handling (Zaidi et al.).

For storing data, PostgreSQL was selected as the database of choice. It supports strict schema enforcement through types, constraints, and indexes, which helps ensure that critical data such as listings, user accounts, and transaction records are accurate and reliable. It is also very high performance and supported on a variety of cloud providers as we scale up the project.  PostgreSQL’s ability to handle complex queries, full-text search, and geolocation extensions also positions it well for future features, such as location-based listing searches or advanced filtering capabilities. The GitHub repository would be structured in a way that mirrors the major parts of the application. The folder named “frontend” would house all React and TypeScript code for the user-facing interface. The “backend” folder contains the Node.js Express server, with API routes, authentication logic, and controllers clearly separated. The database folder includes SQL schema files and migration scripts to keep database changes organized over time 

In terms of technical workflows for contributions, At the top level of the repository, the “README.md” file  would introduce the project, explains its purpose, and provides clear setup instructions for local development. A separate “CONTRIBUTING.md” guide would give a step-by-step explanation of how to submit changes (“Best Practices for Maintainers.”). Contributors  would be encouraged to follow best practices such as open issues before submitting large pull requests, and to follow basic conventions for commit messages, branch naming, and pull request merging. Pull requests must pass review before they are merged, with an emphasis not only on code correctness but also on clarity and maintainability. Continuous Integration (CI) tools will be used in this project to automate testing and ensure that all pull requests meet quality standards before they are merged such as Github Actions (Finley and Davis). As the project merges from early phases to later phases, I plan to expand the pipeline to include automated linting and formatting checks, reducing friction during reviews and maintaining consistency across the codebase using more robust tools such as CircleCI (“6 Open Source CI/CD Tools in 2025”) . During early development, the project can be easily deployed on services like Vercel. As the platform scales, it can likely be containerized on a framework Docker and deployed on more robust cloud platforms like AWS. Depending in the technical strength of the team and the costs, we may even choose to deploy the project on AWS immediately .  AWS would allow us to autoscale server traffic up and down, and give us more reliable cloud costing, so migrating to AWS in the long term would be important. This  approach ensures that Campuscribs can grow alongside its user base ans scale up.  Overall, the technical infrastructure is not overly complex by design. It is meant to balance real-world production standards with accessibility for new contributors. Campuscribs aims to be a project that is easy to spin up locally, easy to contribute to, and easy to extend, which would reflect the technical ability of initial contributions such as myself and a true commitment to open-source collaboration for other like-minded technical contributors to have a real impact on this important open source project. 

_**Project Strategy and Management**_ 

In terms of thinking about Project Strategy and Management, I will be applying  core principles I learned in IS 340 about creating a healthy, sustainable project environment where ideas can evolve based on community feedback. Specifically, I will be centering around three central principles we learned in class and based on my own online research: open collaboration, active user feedback, and continuous iteration.

For the principle of open and distributed  collaboration,  GitHub issue boards will serve as the central planning tool. A Github Projects Kanban-style board will be set up with columns for “Backlog,” “In Progress,” “Review Needed,” and “Completed.” All features, bugs, enhancements, and design ideas will be logged as individual issues (GitHub). Each issue will include a clear description, expected behavior, and acceptance criteria to reduce ambiguity and improve contributor participation. Labels such as "Good First Issue," "Help Wanted," and "Discussion Needed" will help organize and designate appropriate tasks for different contributor skill levels (Wheeler). 

For the principle of community feedback and evaluation, active feedback will be gathered through lightweight surveys, GitHub Discussions, and informal conversations with early testers from local college campuses. Students will be invited to share what features they find most valuable, what pain points they still encounter, and what improvements they would like to see. All code submissions will require linked issues, clear commit messages, and at least one review before merging. Review feedback will focus on clarity, performance, and maintainability rather than only correctness (Wade). 

As the community grows, the organization structure will go from a “flat” management structure where all contributors would report to me to transitioning into having experienced contributors will be invited to take on more formal roles such as triaging issues, reviewing pull requests, or managing specific parts of the project (for example, frontend UI consistency or database optimization) (“Leadership and Governance.”). The broader strategy is to keep transparency and community decision-making at the core of Campuscribs’ development. 

For the principle of project sustainability, managing and budgeting costs will be critical to Campuscribs' long-term sustainability. Hosting, domain registration, and API usage fees will be tracked in a transparent project ledger on Excel, updated monthly to ensure that expenses stay within reasonable bounds. This ledger will follow open principles and be open for the public to view. Open-source-friendly platforms and free-tier services will be leveraged wherever possible to minimize early-stage costs. To support future growth, fundraising efforts will focus on a combination of small grants (particularly those supporting student innovation and open-source initiatives), sponsorships from local businesses, and voluntary community contributions through platforms like GitHub Sponsors or Open Collective. 




**Target Audience and Community**

The community strategy for Campuscribs is built on two parallel goals. The first would be to serve the student users who need the platform. The second would be to build an active network of technical contributors who will help improve and sustain it. We already understand that the primary user audience is undergraduate and graduate students who are seeking short-term housing options near their campuses. These students often need temporary accommodations for summer internships,  co-ops, or mid-year housing transitions such as coming to and from college transfers or study abroad or exchange programs. Campuscribs is designed in mind for this audience and is hoping to  provide a smoother, safer, and more centralized alternative than existing competitors. The platform will be especially attractive to students who value verified listings, easy search functionality, and a clean, professional user experience that mirrors modern consumer platforms like Zillow or Airbnb.

On the technical side, Campuscribs aims to cultivate a contributor community composed of technical developers and designers. Technical contributors may include a variety of people from different backgrounds, but primarily it is likely that it will include computer science and engineering students focusing on building a strong project portfolio for internships and job interviews. The University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign is a top computer science, engineering, and information science school. It is very likely that it will be easy to recruit great people to contribute to the project, especially if it helps them.

To develop the open-source community for this project,  the repository will maintain a welcoming, atmosphere. Good first issues, detailed onboarding instructions, and examples for submitting contributions will lower the barriers to entry. Clear labeling and a strong emphasis on helpful code reviews will ensure that contributors feel supported rather than overwhelmed with the project. 

Second, Campuscribs will actively seek partnerships with UIUC student organizations, coding clubs, and other university resources. By offering directly making the project more community oriented as situated on UIUC’s campus as a start,  it can serve as both a useful platform and a learning opportunity. Hackathons, coding events, and workshops could feature Campuscribs modules as entry points for hands-on learning about real-world application development.

Finally, to make sure that both users and contributors stay connected, communication channels such as GitHub, or Slack/Discord servers will be set up. Transparency around project direction, updates, and priorities will build trust and encourage a sense of shared ownership among everyone involved and will be posted on these forums. 

**Conclusion**

Campuscribs is driven by the overarching motives of  empowering students with better tools for managing their housing needs, and to empower contributors with a welcoming, transparent, and impactful open-source project, especially for technical college students . If successful,  Campuscribs will revolutionize the way students think about short-term housing on college campus, and will truly disrupt one of the most sluggish industries. By giving students a great, central platform to find and lease student housing properties, Campuscribs can be wildly successful and provide a meaningful impact to a real problem on college campuses today.

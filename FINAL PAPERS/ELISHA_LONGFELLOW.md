# Final Paper

### Abstract:

In this paper, I discuss the creation of an open-source mobile application based on an already existing application that will demonstrate core course concepts through its creation and future sustainability. By examining the technical foundation, unique feature set, and community-driven structure of the proposed application, this project demonstrates key course concepts such as blockchain integration, open-source collaboration, system scalability, and user-centered design. Emphasis is placed on long-term sustainability, personalization, and the ability for users and developers to contribute to the platform post-launch. This application will not only serve as a digital collectible marketplace but also as a case study in decentralized, fan-driven software innovation.

### Introduction:

This application is based on Korean entertainment company Modhaus’ application called Cosmo: The Gate, or Cosmo for short. Cosmo currently serves as a blockchain-based platform for digital photocard ownership and trading, primarily targeting K-pop fans. While the core idea of tokenized fan interaction is compelling, the closed nature of Cosmo limits broader customization, transparency, and community participation. Since this would be based on an already existing app, it is important to come up with distinctions. This application would have an internal trade board, would allow you to organize your digital goods in your library, upgrade your goods, have animated pcs, as well as trade multiple cards at once on the blockchain, which would overall reduce traffic on the network and keep the prices low. 
Furthermore, by adopting an open-source model and prioritizing user customization, the application aims to create a more transparent and participatory environment. Fans and developers alike will be able to influence the platform’s future, making it a sustainable and community-driven alternative to existing fan engagement applications.

### Target Audience:

The target audience for this application is fans of whatever industry would choose to pick it up. This application can be used for photocards for K-pop groups, trading cards for video games, board games, or card games, and could even be integrated into the Western market for collectibles such as baseball trading cards. However, depending on how one would want to market this, the target audience can also be companies or corporations seeking to find a new way to build fan engagement and community.

### Phase 1 Foundation and Dev:

Phase 1 focuses on planning, setting up infrastructure, and establishing the essential technical groundwork for the application. This phase differentiates the platform from existing ones like COSMO by emphasizing open-source flexibility, user customization, and scalable blockchain integration from the ground up. At this stage, it's critical to outline what the application will contain, how users will interact with it, and what will set it apart from similar platforms. While COSMO centers around NFT-based photocards and a closed ecosystem, this project aims to expand fan engagement through greater transparency, modifiability, and long-term user control. Early documents should describe the application's unique value proposition and how it will support both casual users and developers.

In order to make any application, having a roadmap is a must. This roadmap outlines the project’s timeline, development milestones, testing phases, and eventual release goals. It helps the team coordinate responsibilities and set realistic deadlines. In open-source or community-driven models, it also provides transparency and encourages contributor trust. Early wireframes and user flow diagrams can be developed during this phase to visualize the user experience and identify friction points before development begins. This step also ensures that the application is intuitive and accessible to both new and experienced users in the fandom space. A good roadmap can include checkpoints for beta releases, community testing rounds, and iterative feedback loops, which are all essential for making sure the app evolves based on real user needs.

One of the foundational choices in this project is the use of blockchain technology. After evaluating multiple options, Polygon stands out due to its low transaction fees, high throughput, and eco-friendly proof-of-stake consensus. Alternatives like Abstract (or other Layer 1/Layer 2 chains) can be evaluated based on speed, community support, and developer tools. The codebase must be compatible with blockchain architecture. This requires a clear mapping of which components will live on-chain (e.g., NFTs, votes, ownership) and which remain off-chain (UI state, media storage etc,.). This distinction is important because it directly affects app performance and cost. Putting everything on-chain might seem more decentralized, but can slow down transactions and increase gas fees.

Other than the differing features mentioned, an in-app currency can be included that allows users to make purchases with it, or use it for community voting, an in app customer service like, exclusive content drops, etc,. This currency could also help create a reward system, where users earn tokens for activity or engagement, which can later be used within the app. This kind of ecosystem encourages deeper participation and lets fans feel like they have a real stake in the platform, beyond just consuming content.
How big of a team that is needed for this project depends on the scale. As a start up, one could get away with three people. But a larger company would need a broader team of staff, including designers, community managers, legal advisors, and QA testers. If this is a smaller project run by a few people, it would be easier to use something like Discord or Slack for close communication, as tasks would not get lost too easily in channels. These platforms allow for quick discussion, decision-making, and the ability to track updates in real-time. And finally, there must be privacy policies and terms of service created for the application to protect both the company and its users from harm. This ensures user trust, protects the project legally, and prepares for broader community participation. Even in a small team, clear task delegation and regular check-ins are vital for staying aligned and avoiding delays.

### Phase 2 Finalization and Public Launch Preparation:

Phase 2 is focused on finalizing the application and preparing it for a smooth public launch. This phase ensures that all core features, including blockchain integration, are fully functional, secure, and optimized for the end user. It is crucial that extensive testing occurs at this stage to guarantee that the platform is reliable, user-friendly, and free of critical bugs.
Phase 2 is finalization for the public launch which would include integrating the blockchain functions and putting them through rigorous testing. It would be important to run tests both internally with a team and run an exclusive beta with the public to get non-biased feedback. These testers can provide invaluable insights on user experience, interface usability, and any issues that may not have been uncovered during internal testing. It’s important to limit the beta to a select group of users who represent the target audience. These tests would involve profile creation, making purchases in the application shop, trade between users, security testing, and finally fixing all the bugs that result from these tests. 
Following both internal and beta testing, a critical phase will be to address any bugs or issues that emerge. The development team will need to prioritize fixing any security vulnerabilities, transaction failures, or user experience hiccups before moving on to the official launch. Bug fixes and improvements should be closely tracked in issue-tracking tools like GitHub to ensure that no issues are missed.
The integration of blockchain functionality is one of the most important steps in this phase. This includes implementing NFT minting, transactions, and user wallet support, as well as testing the smart contracts to ensure that all blockchain-related functions work seamlessly. Blockchain features must be rigorously tested for both security and performance. It’s also important to ensure that the smart contracts handle user interactions like voting, transactions, and content ownership correctly and without vulnerabilities.
To prepare for the public launch, you would want to make sure that the application has tutorials that pop up for first-time users These tutorials should be optional but easily accessible to provide a seamless introduction to new users. For returning users, these tutorials should be skippable to prevent redundancy. It's also helpful to provide a “help” section that offers FAQs, troubleshooting tips, and video guides for more detailed user needs.

### Phase 3 Customization and Personalization:

Phase 3 is all about allowing users to take control of their experience on the platform, both by customizing their individual profiles and by enabling the broader community to participate in the platform’s evolution. This phase enhances user engagement by offering personalization options that reflect the diversity of the fanbase and creating an open, user-driven environment.
One of the biggest draws of open-source platforms is the ability for users to directly influence and personalize their experience. In this phase, providing tools and resources for users to customize elements of the app, from layout adjustments to integrating new features, will help foster a stronger sense of ownership and community. This could include profile customization and display preferences, UI layout customization etc,. For more advanced users or developers, providing a system to integrate or build small plugins could be a great feature. The open-source nature of the platform allows for ongoing development and customization from the community. Allowing users to contribute their code and ideas can help the platform grow organically and evolve beyond the initial features set by the core development team. 
Beyond layout customization, Phase 3 should also focus on refining the way the app responds to individual user behavior, preferences, and interactions. By this point, there should be a strong feedback loop in place for continuous improvement.

### Technical Debt:

Given the ambitious scope and evolving nature of this application, the technical debt is expected to be high. In the case of this project, much of that debt will likely accumulate due to 
rapid feature expansion, limited initial team size, the complexity of blockchain integration, and the demands of supporting both open-source contributions and a high standard of user security.
One of the largest contributors to technical debt in this project will be blockchain integration, particularly if smart contracts are written without future-proofing or modularity in mind. As user needs change or as the blockchain platform evolves (e.g., a shift from Polygon to Abstract or another chain), outdated contracts may require significant rewrites, migrations, or re-audits—costly both in terms of time and resources.
Additionally, user-facing features such as card upgrades, animated collectibles, and layout customization, while appealing and fun for the community, require substantial front-end logic and constant backend syncing. These areas are prone to accumulating "invisible" debt if quick patches are applied to fix visual bugs without addressing underlying architecture issues. This can lead to mounting problems in later development phases, particularly when scaling the app or introducing localization and accessibility features.
Overall, there is high technical debt, but users would enjoy the platform and sometimes having a good application that everyone enjoys should take precedent over the upkeep costs.

### Pros and Cons:

An application like this, like all projects, comes with its pros and cons. There may be an equal number between both sides, but some weigh more than others. Some of the pros are increased fan engagement, scam prevention, environmental friendliness, and that the application is open source.
Increasing fan engagement is always a pro in order to grow your business or project. By building the application with exclusive content and many other features, you can draw people into using it and building a healthy fan-to-company relationship.

Another pro is scam prevention and or scam follow-up. Transactions between users can be tracked on the blockchain and or application. By building a community space, a company using this application can track trades and follow up on reports from users about being scammed and get their digital goods back to the right owner as well as ban the scammers from using the application. 

Another pro is this application can be used in an environmentally friendly way. While blockchains do cost energy, some blockchains have been made to reduce their carbon footprint at the demand for more eco-friendly blockchain solutions. Polygon and Abstract are two blockchains that have a significantly low carbon footprint and are prime choices to pick from for this project. While they still use energy, you also have to consider that making physical goods, like photocards, also has an environmental impact. Resources are used up to make them, and even more resources are used up to ship them out to the right locations. Physical cards do not need to be completely replaced; in fact, Modhaus still makes physical photocards for some releases and puts a scannable QR code on the back of them so they can be scanned into the Cosmo application so users can have them in their digital log as well as physically. Some people may enjoy physically collecting while others enjoy not having so many things taking up physical space and prefer the digital collecting aspect of the application. 

And finally, the application being open source is a pro for fan engagement. Allowing fans to take the code from the application to make adjustments and additions to it like desktop widgets, plugins or mods, creating background themes, or even third-party applications can be a great way to get the community involved creatively. After all, fans love to see their creations integrated into an application and it encourages others to try as well. People who are getting started with code can also look at the code and gain inspiration from it for their own uses outside of the community and can be used as a teaching mechanism. However, bigger corporations interested in this would more than likely not use open source code.

Even with the pros, there also come cons. The cons are privacy, blockchain traffic, high cost upkeep, and the public view of NFTs and blockchain technology. 
One issue with having the application be open source is privacy for its can be at risk. 

In released Modhaus content, idols showed off their Cosmo application on their phone when discussing Objekts and the serial numbers of the digital photocards they owned were showed. Due to fan created third party applications made to help track Objekts and create wishlists, fans were able to figure out the idols' Cosmo profiles. Since then, Modhaus has blurred the serial numbers on Objekts in the content they release. They even switched from using the blockchain Polygon to Abstract recently, which provides higher application security and has rendered the two most popular fan-created third-party websites (Apollo and Nova) completely useless as it is no longer compatible with Cosmo. The change to Abstract was good for the protection of Modhaus employees and community users. It will be difficult to make a collaborative application with an issue as serious as user privacy, but it could be possible.

Another con is blockchain traffic. Sometimes the blockchains do not work properly because of other applications and companies using the blockchain all at once and clogging the network. This can become an issue, especially during purchasing time for digital goods as users would want to trade cards between each other. However, if the blockchain is backed up, users cannot send cards to each other. This can become a frustrating experience for users.
One of the biggest cons for this project is the high cost of upkeep. An application like this would need people constantly fixing bugs within the application like issues minting digital goods, goods disappearing, reward rollouts not being given to users correctly, etc,. While some issues can lie in the blockchain itself, if the application code is not crisp enough, it can cause the whole project to fall apart. If users have too many issues using the application, it can really turn them off to using and you will begin to lose your user base. 

The final con to be discussed is the public view of NFT and blockchain technologies. A while back, there was the Bored Ape NFT that circulated around. This was possibly the first time some people became aware of NFTs after seeing it online a lot. Some blockchains use significant energy and leave a massive carbon footprint. With the discussion of this in online spaces, it created a surge of anti-NFT mentality, which it is perfectly understandable and reasonable to be concerned about the planet. Polygon and Abstract are two blockchains that have a very tiny carbon footprint and are safe choices for this application. However, with the public opinion towards NFTs, this way of building and using an application can be off-putting to people which is why it is important to be transparent about how the blockchains are used.

### Summary:

In summary, this paper has outlined the planning, development, and long-term goals of an open-source mobile application designed to enhance digital fan engagement through blockchain technology and community-driven features. By examining each development phase—from initial infrastructure and blockchain integration to final launch and post-release customization—the project demonstrates a commitment to transparency, scalability, and user empowerment.
Through features such as multi-card blockchain trading, animated collectibles, in-app currency, and user interface personalization, the application aims to provide a more flexible and inclusive alternative to closed platforms like Cosmo. The adoption of eco-conscious blockchain solutions like Polygon or Abstract further supports sustainable practices, while the open-source model encourages innovation and creative contributions from the community.
While challenges such as privacy concerns, blockchain congestion, and public skepticism toward NFTs remain, this application has the potential to evolve into a secure, interactive, and adaptable space for both users and developers. By fostering collaboration and prioritizing user needs, it offers a modern blueprint for fan engagement platforms in the digital age.

# CommondGround - Final Paper
**Jade Carthans - IS 340: Project Management, Spring 2025**

### Background

In every local community, numerous non-profit and social impact organizations work to coordinate and execute events and volunteer opportunities to improve the overall community. From food banks, shelters, animal humanitarian groups, and small businesses, organizations and entities within your community work every day to make the world a better place. However, as much impact as these institutions bring, there is also the struggle to make individuals aware of their presence to further their cause and gain more involvement. Even in my own experience, many opportunities I hear about are word-of-mouth of knowing individuals who are personally involved or have witnessed these organizations. Alternatively, individuals may intentionally visit their website or social media pages for additional information. This poses challenges for social impact groups to gain visibility, engage the community in local events, secure additional resources, and expand their volunteer base, as these are limited avenues to market and connect with community members. I propose creating a community resource forum that allows local nonprofits and businesses to share posts and events about improving social impact. This community forum web application would allow for opportunities for these local organizations to get more involvement and outreach within a community.

 ### Purpose 
The purpose of CommonGroup is to provide a central and convenient digital platform solution to connect community members with their local non-profit organizations and socially responsible small businesses. The platform will provide an intuitive, all-in-one space to share information, events, and requests for assistance. CommonGround will connect individuals directly with local social impact organizations and serve as a marketing hub for these organizations to grow their presence. According to Werke and Bogale (2023), effective marketing is crucial for the success and growth of non-profit organizations in diverse communities. It enhances fundraising efforts and attracts volunteers. A clearer public image captures the attention of various stakeholders, potentially increasing the demand for non-profit services in the local community.

### Vision Statement
CommonGround is a collaborative digital solution that showcases posts, events, and opportunities from local non-profit organizations and small businesses to capture the community's attention for visibility, foster engagement, and expand the impact of each organization’s efforts.



###  Target Audience
From a user perspective, CommonGround is built for community members who are interested to get involved in local social impact efforts across a range of causes and have a central place to look for opportunities to give, volunteer and promote.In addition, CommonGround serves a hub for community members can easily discover free local resources such food distributions events, shelter availability and more to support them for the best outreach. On the other hand, CommonGround also serves as a central platform for small and mid-sized nonprofits to share their work, highlight community needs, and promote opportunities for engagement.

###  Features

## Timeline Objectives

### Project Planning
The project's planning phase is centered around setting a clear foundation for what the platform is aiming to accomplish and outlining what success would look like. The phase defines the core objectives and sets measurable goals that align with the intended purpose of CommonGround. Alongside the objectives, the planning process also involves determining the scope of Version 1. What features are considered high priority for the first launch? What elements will be saved for future iterations based on time and capacity? To stay organized, timelines will be created for each development stage, assigning specific tasks and deadlines to team members. These timelines will remain flexible and open to adjustments depending on unexpected barriers or complications that may arise during development. The goal is to have consistent check-ins and communication with team leads throughout the planning phase and beyond to guide the project toward its launch in a manageable way.

### Onboarding
The onboarding process is concentrated on the hiring of the central team members to execute this project from start to finish. The team will consist of 3 designers and 4 developers. The developer team will split based on the context of implementation, there will be 2 front-end developers and 2 back-end developers. The front-end developers will closely collaborate with the design team to bring their wireframe designs and prototyping to life through continuous communication of guidelines of design system and user interaction. The back-end team will ensure the web application is seamless in interacting with database systems and geographic assets such as the interaction map. Furthermore, a significant portion of initial costs will be allocated to the onboarding phase, during which software licenses for tools like Figma, GitHub Team, Adobe, AWS Cloud Database, and Slack will be acquired for team communication and software development. 

### User Research
The initial research phase is focused on determining what features and systems would best benefit nonprofits and community members to engage together. The central contributors of the project will understand what the initial products and technologies are already being used to market and connect with local communities. The user research process will target understanding users’ pain points for current technologies and what they feel is missing/or needed for their organization to see increasing growth. In addition, in the perspective of the community members, the research phase will venture out to understand what common ways individuals hear about these social impacts groups and discover what motivates them to engage with them in donations or volunteering. 

The user research process will primarily focus on a target community, Bloomington, IL to isolate groups to target in the initial launch. There will be 10 different non-profit and small (social impact) businesses interviews. Sample questions will consistent of:
- What are some common non-profit outreach challenges that they experience in gaining visibility locally?
- What current technologies and tools do they use to promote their organization when it comes to announcement, resources and volunteer opportunities?
- Are there any faults or frustrations when it comes to the use of these technologies?

There will also be 30 different community member interviews to show how the platform can best cater to gain traction to diverse audiences. Sample questions will consistent of:
- What is the typical way you engage with non-profit/social impact organizations?
- What type of aspects of an organization do you look for to engage with (volunteer, donate, or sponsor)?


###  Design
The design process involves designers using previously gathered research and insights to brainstorm and develop the initial designs of the web application. The focus will be on creating a version for the launch based on the project's scope and objectives, while additional ideas will be set aside for future iterations. To ensure that front-end developers and other team members understand the product structure, designers will provide documentation detailing the information architecture and how various components flow together to meet user objectives. In addition, a design system and components will be developed to maintain consistency and standardization across the platform and any future updates. At the end of this design phase, the front-end development team will have high-fidelity prototypes that closely resemble the final product. It will reflect the community forum web application's visual design, functionality, branding, and user experience. 

### Front-End Development
The next phase of the project is focused on implementing the product designs and reviewing the finalized wireframes with communication between the design team and the developers. It is recognized if there are discrepancies between the implementation of the designs versus what was truly ideated. If changes are made in this phase, they will be documented in the previous design reports and comments within the code to ensure seamless integration with other contributions or future updates. The tools used within this phase will be React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These tools are widely used within the open-source community in web development. They are common and flexible when contributing to the community forum web application. React provides the ability to build reusable components that speed up the development process and make the UI manageable. Furthermore, HTML and CSS will handle the basic structuring and styling of web elements. Javascript will contribute to the dynamic behavior and interaction of the web application. 

###  Back-End Development
Similar to the front-end development phase, the back-end development phase is focused on building the core functionality of the community forum web application. This phase's objective is to support and handle the user interaction and data management of the application when fully integrating the core features. The main core features that need to be handled on the back-end are the creation of profiles, alerts of notifications, user authentication, and creating and managing posts and events. 

One of the main tools of the back-end team will be Node.js to develop the back-end services. Node.js fundamental tool to use for the community forum as it integrates with Javascript to be used on both the front-end and back-end. It is asynchronous and has an event-driven architecture, making it highly suitable for real-time applications. This is valuable as the community forum needs to stay up-to-date on the events, announcements, and resources of organizations in real time, or the information is ineffective. With a smaller team working on this open-source project, the pre-built available tools and large ecosystem help the back-end team with time efficiency and savings in implementation and testing. 

With the AWS Cloud Subscription, PostgreSQL will be used as the primary database system, and additional PostGIS integration will be used to manage and query spatial data for mapping features. This allows the application to accurately connect users to nearby community events and resources. Mapbox will be used to visually display local posts with interactive and filterable layers for the mapping feature. Using these tools through AWS allows the advantage of automation regarding backups, replication, encryption, and integration with other AWS services. 
For further maintenance and observations of the web application, an admin dashboard will be created to monitor the site's activity, user analytics, and potential errors. React-Admin will be used to generate this insightful platform for team leaders to observe. 

### User Testing
In this phase, after ideation and implementation, the goal is to test Version 1 as much as possible to find any unexpected errors, user flows, or concerns that have not been addressed. The team leads will conduct at minimum 10 usability interviews with diverse community members and non-profit organizations to create profiles, test user behaviors, and highlight any initial addressable pain points. In this process, the team leads will prioritize core changes that need to be addressed in this initial version of the launch. There will be additional communication with the design, front-end, and back-end teams to implement. Other changes will be added to the backlog for future iterations other than Version 1.

### Beta Testing
The beta testing phase will focus on partnering with selected non-profit organizations to sample-test the community forum and its core features, such as posting announcements and creating events. The goal is to observe how real users engage with the platform in a live environment and identify gaps in usability, performance, and functionality that were missed in user testing. Feedback from these early testers will help guide the refinement of the application prior to the official launch. During this phase, any significant issues or concerns will be addressed and documented based on severity and manageability. Final adjustments will be a collaboration between the design and developers. Insights from the testing requiring high restructuring are placed on the backlog outside the project scope.


### Launch
The final phase of the launch is centered on the release of the Version 1 digital web application platform. The website would be publicly available for all users to join and create profiles to interact with all established features. The period will be the transition from internal development and testing to an existing product on the web. If there are any urgent issues or feedback from users, it will be documented and reviewed by the team leads and core team members. This is where the admin dashboard will play a crucial role in observing user analytics and engagement success metrics.

### Addressing Technical Debt
Addressing technical debt is a major part of the open-source development process to ensure that future contributors can work with a stable and adaptable system. One possible area of technical debt is incomplete or outdated documentation. With this project, I want contributors to be able to adapt the platform to their own local needs, and strong documentation plays a critical role in that. It’s important that the setup process, APIs, and component behaviors are clearly explained so that developers aren’t blocked when referencing older resources or trying to build onto the system. Another potential risk is poor testing, especially around edge cases that aren’t accounted for early on. Bugs or errors can pop up in ways that aren’t immediately obvious. In the initial planning phase, I allocated time for user testing to catch unexpected behaviors. I also plan to set aside time for developers to conduct unit testing and check that edge cases are handled properly, so we’re not just testing at the surface level but catching potential issues that could impact future iterations.

### Open-Source Collaboration
CommonGround is an innovative open-source project designed to foster collaboration among developers, designers, and technologists, with the goal of enhancing the platform's capabilities to better serve diverse local communities and their unique needs. By leveraging the collaborative features of GitHub, CommonGround aims to create a centralized space where contributors can work together more effectively.

This platform encourages teamwork by enabling members to propose new features, address issues, and submit pull requests to enhance the project's functionality and user experience. As new ideas and solutions are introduced through this collaborative effort, the project seeks to iterate and evolve continuously, ensuring that it remains responsive to the varying circumstances of the communities it serves.

### Challenges
One open-source challenge is the platform's scalability in further development of other iterations of the web application. With the initial Version 1 focusing on an isolated community of Bloomington, IL, the next iterations should adapt to additional local areas. The first iteration's research and development was based on community members' and nonprofit organizations' needs and requirements, specifically within Bloomington. As the platform expands, each new city or region is expected to have different cultural dynamics, expectations, and digital habits when engaging with nonprofits or discovering local events. This means the platform needs to remain flexible and adaptable while maintaining a core structure that reflects the mission and values of CommonGround. From a design and feature perspective, this includes accommodating region-specific categories, languages, or filtering options. However, the expansion also introduces a deeper technical scaling challenge. Supporting multiple locations requires stronger backend systems to manage and filter spatial data accurately across regions, as well as optimizing the performance of the database to handle an increased volume of posts, users, and location-based queries. This scaling can lead to slower performance, bugs, or even data mismanagement without proper planning and testing, especially in a live, multi-city environment.

Another open-source challenge is deciding how additional contributions are reviewed and approved as an open-source project on GitHub. Long-term planning is needed to establish transparent, open-source governance to maintain consistency as the platform grows. Without a clear system of open source governance, there will be challenges of disconnected development or overlapping features that do not integrate or interact well. Furthermore, these inconsistencies, especially with quality, could also lead to unexpected code errors or bugs that disrupt the functionality of the web application platform. Additional contributors should feel welcome to add their ideas and concepts. However, it is important to ensure that there is still a solidified structure regarding the quality and direction of the project that is aligned with the base values and mission. A contribution guideline document would be beneficial to address the review process, highlight primary operations, and understand the significance of each change made to the project. This document could include best practices for coding standards, documentation requirements, and testing procedures to enhance overall quality.

A key challenge in the long-term of the project is the continuous participation of nonprofit organizations and small businesses in actively posting and updating their profiles. While the technology can benefit marketing and collaboration with a local community, the platform does not fulfill its purpose if there is no real engagement from users or the target audiences. Many of these organizations operate with limited staff, time, and digital expertise resources to engage fully in the platform. It could create technological barriers in getting them to update information consistently, post events, and digitally engage with community forum features. To target this challenge, an intuitive and clear onboarding process is essential to decrease the amount of time for the learning process of the platform. In the same regard, the beta testing will also help with partnerships with local community nonprofit organizations to guide them on the use of the platform and build value for the product to amplify their communication and marketing efforts.

### Conclusion
CommonGround aims to redefine community engagement by fostering meaningful connections between residents and social impact organizations. The platform is designed to drive positive social change and the better overall well-being of the community. Connecting individuals with groups in a central hub will enhance the ability to view and create posts, events, and opportunities. This streamlining process enables direct support to these vital organizations through donations, sponsorships, volunteering, or usage.

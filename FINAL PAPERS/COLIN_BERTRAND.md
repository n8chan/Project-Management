## Spotify Top 10 Tracker

### INTRODUCTION
---
#### BACKGROUND
There are a multitude of different streaming services available to the public, but there are clear dominators of the industry. As recent as 2024, Spotify holds ownership of 34% of the market, around double what the next in line owns (Curry). It’s clear that Spotify has a lead in the streaming industry with its 350 million users. Spotify’s success is also in debt to some of its progressive features, including an infamous “Spotify Wrapped”, which generates a tailored report to each user at the end of the year. 

Spotify Wrapped has been launched for around 10 years, the data and analytics that go into the experience have continued to grow (Spotify). Wrapped allows a user to see their top songs and artists from the last year, along with many statistics that surround a user’s listening habits. This is a fun and exciting experience to uncover stats, but users have little control over what statistics are available to them, and how they are displayed. 

#### PURPOSE

With data’s surge in value, it makes sense for users to be able to have some control over how their data can be used. While Spotify Wrapped automatically generates a user’s listening trends, they are losing out on insights from lots of other data points. 

This app will allow users to manually select and update their current “Top 10” songs and track the data-driven insights based on those songs. This will allow a user to see analytics based on songs that they are actively trying to listen to. A user’s top songs may be based on the length of the song, generating more listening time for longer songs or more instances of listening for shorter songs. 

The app provides an easy interface for users to reflect on their listening habits and watch how their music taste may change throughout time. It blends passive Spotify data with active user input, effectively allowing the user to have some more control over their analytics. Featuring a main interchangeable playlist of ten songs, either ranked or unranked, the app will track data based on those songs through the Spotify API and create visualizations and reports based on those current ten songs.

#### TARGET AUDIENCE

This app can technically be utilized by all 350 million of Spotify’s users, but realistically not all users are going to care as thoroughly for their statistics. Music enthusiasts, or Spotify’s most active users would likely be interested in this app. It allows them to be more organized when it comes to keeping track of their music. This also offers a lot of social media potential for influencers. Spotify Wrapped is often posted all over social media apps as a way for users to share their listening data, and the visualizations generated by this app would be no different. 

Casual music listeners can also get a good experience out of this app, as it allows them to curate their “musical identity”. Instead of falling into the trap of repeatedly listening to the same songs, this allows users to find songs that stand out to them and continue expanding their library. 

### Project Workflow

Above is an example of what the Project Workflow would look like for the app. It follows a 12-week implementation plan. 

#### Research and Planning:

Week 1-2

Weeks 1 and 2 would start off defining the project goals and assessing the possibilities. The first step would be to come to the table with the abstract of the project. A set of ideas for the project, whether they’re possible or not. This would be defining core features that would feasibly call the app a success. These can also come from talking to the stakeholders, or anyone who is invested/shown interest in the project. It’s the responsibility of the project manager to keep the stakeholders informed and also involved in the process of the project (Teamwork).

Next would be researching the Spotify API. There is a difference in documentation for a Web app and an iOS or Android app, so figuring out what is possible under the scope of the project is important.  Thankfully, Spotify’s main page for their API tells us the API “enables the creation of applications that can interact with Spotify's streaming service, such as retrieving content metadata, creating and managing playlists, or controlling playback” (Spotify for Developers). While the Spotify Api is free to use, their may be features that require a Premium Membership, and the API requires users to follow Spotify’s policies. By finding the documentation, we are able to find what features are possible to implement into the app, and what the limitations might be that could be an obstacle in the future.  

Finally, roles within the team can start to be delegated. These are responsibilities like developers (backend and frontend), UX designers, and managers. This is also where the technical stack would be created, so that possible risk in the future can be assessed. The research and planning allows the team to have a set of goals that act as the minimum viable product and serve as a guideline for the project. 

#### Design:

Week 3-4

The design process would start off with the frame of the app. Frames for the mobile interface would be made to serve as a way to visualize the implementation. There are key interactions with the app that would need to be smooth for the users. These may be logging into Spotify with the app, uploading past listening data into the app, searching for songs, the selection process for a top 10 song, and viewing the saved top 10 list. 

With these interactions, the team would move on to creating mockups. This allows the team to track how these interactions would look. It also allows the team to set the aesthetic for the app, and test what may look best for the app. With these mockups, the team can track the way a user may use the app. By bringing in test groups, the mockups can be interacted with, and those interactions tracked as “user flow”. The user flow is then used as a guideline to implement the features based on how a user will go about using the app. 

This step also allows the team to account for outlying instances. There is a possibility that some users want less than 10 songs on their list, or there is not enough listening data to create quality statistics/visualizations. These problems can be caught and fixed at this step instead of bottlenecking into a bigger issue later. 

#### Development

Week 5-9

Development has tasks in both the frontend and backend. This can be done concurrently. 

The frontend development will mostly come from Kivy, a python based framework. This framework was chosen highly based off being open source, so no cost, and it’s ability to build a cross-platform mobile app. There’s lots of flexibility for touch based interfaces (GeeksforGeeks). Insights are displayed through simple visualizations or summaries in the app's insights tab, powered by Kivy's graphics layer or a data visualization library like matplotlib or plotly, embedded into Kivy with image exports. Key components include of frontend include:

•	A login screen that initiates OAuth 2.0 via a WebView

•	A track search interface that queries the Spotify API and shows song suggestions in real time

•	A drag-and-drop or tap-to-rank interface for users to manually build and reorder their Top 10 list

•	An Insights tab that displays analytics on the top 10 songs

The backend developers need to focus on tasks like user authentication. This can be done with a protocol like OAuth 2.0. This is the industry standard when it comes to giving a third party access to user data. This will allow the Top 10 tracker app to access the user’s listening data on behalf of the user (Okta). The backend developers would have access to data like recent tracks, playlist manipulation, and user profile info. The app would send a request to Spotify’s endpoints to retrieve the data for each song played, which is mostly metadata like track name, artist, album, play count estimates, and Spotify URIs. The backend stores this data in a database, likely using SQLite for mobile deployment. If cloud based databases were needed in the future, this would be moved to PostgreSQL. Background jobs would likely be scheduled to continuously collect the user’s listening data and refresh the analytics. The backend will use this data to track the top 10 song insights and create reports. These all allow the app to:

•	Track the listening timeline of the top 10 songs

•	Create reports based on the listening data of top 10 songs

•	Visualize the listening patterns 

•	Generate weekly or monthly summaries

The finalization of development leads to the last step, which is releasing a beta version of the app. The beta version would have the implementation of choosing a top 10 song list and basic insights. 

#### Testing

Week 10-11

The release of the beta app allows the team to start testing and gathering data on the app’s performance. Beta testers can use the app as they would normally and give feedback on the UI, any bugs that are popping up, and features that the testers may wish were available. This helps again track the user flow, but also if there are any immediate problems with the way a real person would interact with the app. The team can also see if there are noticeable differences between performances on different systems. Since Kivy is cross platform, an Android and iOS user may have different experiences by accident. 

Simultaneously, the team can keep track of the apps backend logic, making sure the interactions with the Spotify API and database are strong. If there are technical problems with the app, the beta app can be updated and tested again to make sure there are no major problems with the actual retrieving, processing, and displaying of data. Beta testing would last two weeks which allows the team to gather feedback and deploy updates within a reasonable timeframe. 

#### Deployment

Week 12

After beta testing and reconfiguring, the ap would be ready for deployment. The team would have to compile a submission to the App Store for each respective platform, and make sure the app is compliant with each platform. This would also involve creating demos and descriptions for the shop front of the app on the store.  That way users know what the app looks like and does. 

There would be some backend tasks involving preparing for app tracking. Just like what was done in beta testing, but making sure the app interactions are working as the app is deployed, and creating the ability to catch and log an error. This will help solve issues if they arise after deployment. 

The team can also go above and beyond and market the deployment of the app. Since the target audience is likely active on social media, this would be a good place to go. Posting on social media to generate excitement around the launch, or posting to forums involving Spotify topics would help boost initial engagement. 

After that, the app is deployed and ready for future scaling and updating.

### Future Applications 
---

#### More Features

The app has a lot of potential to include more features. The main one planned was to allow the user to create a playlist of their top 10 songs, and create analytics on those songs while they’re on the list. 
One additional feature could be creating a “graveyard playlist”, which is an alternate playlist that includes every song that is and has been on the list. Since a user will likely be changing out songs, it’s a nice way to remember what songs used to be their favorite. 

Another feature would be increased customization of the visualizations. If users want to post on social media, they will likely want to have some control over what the visualizations look like. This could mean color control, ratio of the exported image, shape of the data, etc. This will motivate the users to export their data visualizations and therefore increase marketing for the app itself. 

The app could also launch its own social aspect of the app. Maybe users with similar top 10 songs want to interact with each other. Spotify has the ability to add friends on its platform, the top 10 tracker app can have a similar ability. 

#### Scalability

As the app gets bigger, it will likely need more resources to continue to keep the app running. One possibility is implementing microservices for backend implementations. This basically means the backend team will grow and be split up into smaller tasks, allowing independent services to be done over well-defined APIs (AWS). 

As mentioned before, as the app database grows bigger, it may need to be moved to a cloud-based platform. This would allow for more data at an efficient cost, and a more reliable system. This would create the task of moving over the data, but would prove to be beneficial in the end. 

The app could also be moved to more cross-platform availability. Most users are expected to use this on a mobile app, as that’s where most users are  listening on a streaming service (Statista). A laptop or desktop is close behind, so implementing the app on those devices may be beneficial. This would also allow for syncing of data across platforms. 

#### Other Services

This app was developed specifically with Spotify in mind. This is because majority of music listeners worldwide are using Spotify (reference 1). The app is still losing out on a majority demographic of people, since Spotify represents around a third of the music listening population. Platforms like Apple Music, Amazon Music, or YouTube Music all have users that likely want similar analytics on their listening data. That would be a large project, essentially repeating the entire project workflow for the app but with different APIs and limitations. 

There can also be some version of AI integration that can start recommending songs based on the user’s top 10 songs. Spotify is occasionally accused of pushing out the same types of songs to user’s and lacks a revolving algorithm to help find new music (Community.spotify.com). An AI integration, trained on a dataset to find song similarities, could be integrated to help user’s find similar songs or songs of a certain genre. 

### Anticipated Challenges
---

#### Technical Risks 

The app is using Spotify’s API, which means that there is a reliance on the usability of the API. There may be limitations that the developing team cannot control, and cause problems in accessing user data. 

Receiving data real time is also a risky technique. The app would refresh the database using a background implementation, so as a user listens to a song, it will be input into the database. This requires a lot of computing, but may also create an issue with data consistency. Songs can be skipped, or paused and played again. Making sure that these instances wouldn’t delete or create duplicate instances of listens is important. 

#### User Risks

Part of the process may involve the users uploading their own past streaming data. The Spotify API can only access the information once the app starts running with authorization. Uploading the user’s data creates another step that developers cannot control, only give out detailed instructions for how to download their own data. This creates a risk of a user not being able to put their data in, and therefore having no access to previous listening data. This wouldn’t cause the app not to work, only cut off a large portion of data. 

In order to get current data, the user must go through the OAuth 2.0 process, and allow the top 10 tracker app to access the user’s Spotify data. This may make users uncomfortable, but it’s a common practice amongst apps and will likely not be a large issue. User’s may not know how to login or give permissions once the OAuth 2.0 asks for details. All the developing team can really do is give instructions. 

#### Maintenance 

There is always the risk of not having a backend scale large enough to support the data the app is dealing with. As more and more users start using the app, and as people start listening to more music, the scale of the backend and its database needs to grow too. This will create more cost for the product. 

There may be bugs that are created as more people download the app. This might not have been tested in the project workflow due to the size of the beta testing group. If a problem with the size of users or computing of the data takes place, the project will need to be put under maintenance and likely upscaled as a whole. 

### Conclusion

The Top 10 Tracker app allows Spotify users to curate their own listening analytics and receive insights on the songs they want to. It also automates the process of creating and updating a playlist, which can often be a chore. The app is user centered and can serve as both a creative outlet and a music memory tool. With the 12 week workflow, the app could be developed with a smaller team. There is a lot of potential for future scalability, and the app is implemented around a very popular app that hundreds of millions of people use.

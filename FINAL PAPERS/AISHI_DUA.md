# JamLink
**Aishi Dua -- IS 340 -- Spring 2025**

### Background/Purpose/Target Audience
The idea of the project comes from the understanding and experience that many music streaming platforms do not have a social component. In traditional applications, users have access to a very wide range of music they want to listen to, but there aren't many ways for people to share the most recent song they’ve listened to. JamLink allows users to connect through music. It’s an application that allows users to collaborate, share musical tastes, and discover songs that people like. This leads us to the project's goal: to create a platform where music becomes a shared social experience instead of just a personal activity. 

The main audience for JamLink is teens and young adults, specifically those between the ages of 15 and 30. These users are typically music lovers and socially active online. They tend to create playlists, share them with friends, and find new artists that their friends are listening to. JamLink is a place for people who are socially active and want to be a part of a music community to expand their tastes and express themselves. JamLink is a place where people are looking for a connection through creativity and sound. 

### Project Vision
The vision for JamLink is to have a unique method that allows users to have that social feel when they listen to music. Instead of making music a solitary experience, JamLink allows users to connect, collaborate, and express themselves through sound. The platform allows users to have real-time playlist creation, an extremely easy way to share among friends, and music discovery from what the user’s peers are listening to. It’s more than just a tool, it's a space where people can bond over shared tastes and experiences. Every feature, from interactive playlists to personalized recommendations, allows users to connect with other music lovers. 

JamLink sees the vision of a place where people can interact with each other in more meaningful ways by connecting with music. The vision includes creating a vibrant, creative community where music lovers can not only listen to music but also co-create and experience new music. Whether through collaborative playlists, music trivia, or real-time friend updates, JamLink will be the go-to place for music discovery because of the social aspect. 

### Project Timeline + Workflow
The planning for JamLink is structured around five key phases to make sure that planning is thorough, user-centered, and has smooth implementation.
 - Phase 1: Planning
 - Phase 2: Prototyping and User Testing
 - Phase 3: Overlaps Development and Testing
 - Phase 4: Refinement
 - Phase 5: Product Launch and Ongoing Updates

Phase 1 will involve initial research, feature scoping, and design direction. After that, phase 2 will focus on building wireframes, conducting usability testing, and refining user flows based on feedback, which would span from 2 to 4 months. Then, phase 3, from months 3 to 6, would focus on core features are built and iterated. Phase 4, lasting through month 12, would involve continued testing and performance optimizations to ensure reliability. Lastly, phase 5 would continue on throughout the product launch and would introduce ongoing updates to meet user needs and platform growth. The workflow allows for an agile methodology since we hope to create the platform through iterative feedback and constant improvement. From early planning to post-launch updates, each phase would have clear deliverables to make sure that we are on task. This workflow is structured yet flexible and would allow JamLink to stay user-focused while adapting to challenges that may be faced through development.

### Key Features
JamLink will have many features that make music more interactive, social, and personalized. One main feature that the app will have is playlist creation with custom themes. This would allow users to create and style their playlists in unique ways that reflect their mood or personality. The friend system allows users to follow and connect with their friends and view their real-time activity. These social interactions will allow for music discovery and make it a more social experience. The platform also integrates song recommendations based on users’ social graphs, allowing for viewing which tracks their friends are listening to. 

Besides those features, JamLink plans to incorporate learning tools and music trivia to increase user engagement. This feature isn’t just for entertainment, but also for helping users explore new music that they would not have approached otherwise. The app uses the Spotify API to stream music and enhance the listening experience, and also incorporates platforms like YouTube to expand content access. These features allow for a platform where users can engage with music and socialize with others. 

### Tech + Design Planning
JamLink would have many developer platforms so that it is user-friendly and easy to use. The frontend is planned to be developed using React Native, so that iOS and Android users have easy access to the application. For the backend, the project would use Node.js and MongoDB, which would allow for flexible data storage and responsiveness, which is important for live updates and friend activity feeds. The application will also integrate Spotify and YouTube APIs so that users have access to music streaming and recommendations. Along with this, OAuth 2.0 will allow for secure and streamlined user authentication. This tech stack was chosen because of its scalability and seamless integration potential. 

For the design, JamLink plans to use a dark mode-first approach. The application will use vibrant accent colors, like electric blue, coral pink, and neon green, to have an energetic and modern feel. The typography would be minimalistic and clean, like Poppins or Inter. There would also be rounded, minimal icons to add to the platform’s aesthetic. The visual design involves incorporating many colors while also maintaining a minimalistic aesthetic. The goal for the design is to have a balance between playful and intuitive so that users of all experience levels can access the app with ease and enjoy the personalized experience. 

### Technical Debt
Like many projects, JamLink is projected to have some technical debt. In terms of short-term technical debt, we foresee issues with the quick development decisions made to meet MVP deadlines. This includes temporary components that did not go through testing, unoptimized queries that may impact high load, and other design implementations. While these issues do not impact the entire functionality, they would need to be addressed to make sure that the application runs smoothly. 

Looking at long-term technical debt, we may face problems with the architectural decisions. For example, the flat database structure may not be efficient for how much of new features expand and more user data that will be introduced. Along with this, there is some potential for limited flexibility for feature development or integration with other music platforms beyond Spotify. Along with this, accumulated legacy code coils also have refactoring challenges if not addressed correctly. By identifying and understanding these problem areas early, we plan to incorporate regular reviews of the frontend and backend, as well as phased technical upgrades to prevent long-term complications. 

### Funding
For the funding of JamLink, the team plans to have unique ways of approaching funding. For example, we plan to apply for innovation grants and participate in startup competitions. This would allow us to get investors as well as get our idea out into the world. Along with this, it will allow us to have financial banking and mentorship opportunities. To add to this, JamLink plans to explore brand partnerships, specifically with music-related companies, so that we can increase visibility and secure sponsorships that align with our mission. For long-term sustainability, we plan to implement a freemium model so that the core features for free, while the premium model will have more exclusive features. This strategy will help our initial launch and create a path for recurring revenue. 

### Challenges + Future Considerations
One challenge that JamLink faces is the integration of multiple music APIs, such as Spotify and YouTube, since they both have their own limitations and structures. Along with this, the challenge of real-time sync and social interaction between users may also be a challenge, especially when managing live updates through different devices and network conditions. Another challenge that may occur is maintaining smooth performance when scaling to adapt to a larger user base. We do not want any difficulties if the application is being used by many people at once. These challenges are potential, but we plan to address them so that the app can stay reliable and user-friendly. 

Looking forward, there are some potential ideas for the future that would allow us to enhance the user experience and increase JamLink’s capabilities. One thing we plan to do is incorporate AI-driven playlist recommendations based on user behavior and social interactions. This would allow for more personalized and unique suggestions. Along with this, we plan to create moderation tools that would allow us to manage user-generated content and create a safe community of music lovers. With the growth of the platforms, we may include cross-platform compatibility, increased accessibility features, and more social integrations, so that we can create an ecosystem of people who love to listen to music and want to share it with ease. 

### Summary 
JamLink is an app that is designed to change the way people listen and share music. We plan to combine playlist creation, real-time friend interactions, and music discovery through social networks to create a community of people who love music. With our design approach, tech stack, and unique features, JamLink plans to make music more interactive and personal. The project follows a structured yet flexible timeline and approach with an agile workflow, while addressing short- and long-term debt. The project hopes to implement many funding strategies and is projected to continue growing. JamLink hopes to be a platform for everyone and hopes to continue growing throughout the years.

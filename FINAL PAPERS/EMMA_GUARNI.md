# Disaster Relief App - Final Paper
**Emma Guarni - IS 340: Project Management, Spring 2025**

### Background
Throughout our lives there are things that happen every day that we cannot control. For example, natural disasters are events that could be detrimental and depending on the effect, could be hard for communities to recover from. It is important that an open-source, community driven platform is created to help plan and find solutions for when areas around the country are hit with such disasters. Just this year, we watched 14 hurricanes take place and there was a lot of terror from people living in the state of Florida. If there had been better plans set in place and people stationed to assist with the damage after the hurricanes, it would have made people's lives a lot easier. I would like to propose a Disaster Relief app that allows communities, volunteers, and organizations to collaborate in real-time to help organize relief plans for during and after natural disasters. This app allows for great communication, can be a way to allocate resources, and can assist in coordinating individuals to go volunteer in specific locations. This app would be useful and effective because it allows people in need to be reached quicker and more efficiently. 

### Purpose
This app allows communities, volunteers, and organizations to collaborate in real-time to help organize relief plans for during and after natural disasters. This app would be beneficial for communication, can be a way to allocate resources, and can assist in coordinating individuals to go volunteer in specific locations. This is unlike any other app because people can be reached quicker and more efficiently in times of need. This also can be used for any type of disaster or tragic event. Also, since it works with first responders, you know the app is credible and accessible to all populations. The purpose of this app would be to help solve the problems of delays of aid after natural disasters, inefficient resource distribution to the locations, and poor planning prior and post the event. The goal would be to solve these problems by implementing real-time communication with volunteers, organizations, and first responders. It would also be possible to map resources and coordinate locations of volunteers. The ideal contributors for this app would be software developers and engineers to build the app, UX/UI designers to design the app and its features, disaster response experts to give input on the best content and information to place into the app, crisis mappers to map out the locations of resources as well as disaster areas, data scientists to update numerical data, networking specialists to help with onboarding as well as outreach in the community, and finally community volunteers who are committed to helping locally. 

### Vision Statement 
To give communities, victims, and responders resources and real-time communication, for coordinating natural disaster relief pre and post disaster. 

### Target Audience 
There are multiple audiences for my project because natural disasters affect so many populations. The first target audience would be disaster victims. Victims will have a new resource to use and contact first responders with. First responders are also a target audience because they can use the app for better geolocation of the individuals who were affected by the natural disaster. They will also have real-time communication with people in the area so they can prioritize what to do first when they arrive on scene. Organizations and volunteers are also a target audience because the app is to help pre and post disasters. If volunteers and organizations are aware of a natural disaster hitting an area, they can help prepare and allocate resources in the area. Government agencies are also a target audience because I want the app to be implemented on people’s phone automatically. They can make this happen if they see that the app is beneficial enough for all locations to have it. And finally, community leaders are a target audience because they could use the app to better help their communities in time of need. 

### Features
There are many features in this app that makes it unique. The first would be a real-time resource map. This map is updated consistently and shows the locations of shelters, food stations, medical centers, and water supplies. There is also plenty of information under each location like their capacity, hours, and contact information. The next feature is volunteer coordination. Volunteers will be assigned to different locations. This all depends on the distance they are to the disaster as well as how damaging the disaster was. This is an important feature because it gives coordinators the ability to monitor tasks and check-in on volunteers that are stationed in certain areas. The next feature is real-time communication between every user whether that be first responders, victims, or volunteers. Another feature is emergency alerts and notifications. These alerts will include warnings, evacuation orders, or updates about specific natural disasters. Another important feature is the live GPS volunteer tracking which shows real-time volunteer locations for not only coordination but to make sure they are safe in the areas they were sent to. This tracking would include small details like last-seen status and alerts if a location stops updating. A planned feature for this app would be offline mode and mesh networking. This feature would enable basic communication and location sharing without internet. This is crucial to have implemented into the app because some natural disasters may destroy providers or poles in the area that give internet. Finally, this feature relates to accessibility. I would like to have multi-language and accessibility support. This means that the app will have multiple settings for people who need certain accommodations. Some examples would be high contrast UI, large tap targets on maps and buttons, and screen reader compatibility. I would like the app to run multiple languages because not everyone speaks or communicates the same way. 

### Timeline Objectives 

#### Research and Planning
Since the Research and Planning stage is right after the start of the app build, it is important to start laying out and designing what the app is going to look like. That is why in this stage, the priority tasks will be to create UI/UX prototypes for the app and build wireframes. This can be by using a tool like Figma. We also need to identify user needs. It is crucial to interview and survey the people who will be using the app, like victims, first responders, volunteers, etc., to understand what would be beneficial to them or what they would like to see on the app. Finally, during this stage, it is important to look at the feasibility of our technical stack and determine what budget is the most effective and efficient to get everything we want inside of the app. This will take a decent amount of time to complete because determining a budget can be hard. I do not want to be too much in debt, but I need to weigh the benefits of spending more in the beginning for the long run. 

#### Minimum Viable Product Development and Testing 
During the Minimum Viable Product Development and Testing stage, three tasks will be completed. The first is to build the core features of the app. The core features include crisis mapping with geolocation that resources can be allocated during natural disasters. Another core function is real-time communication. The app would not be beneficial to users if there was no real-time communication. For example, victims will contact first responders and volunteers will be contacted from there to get to the site as quickly as possible. They need to be able to have contact within the app to do this and to be efficient with time. The last core function is volunteer coordination tools. Unlike other apps or the services that first responders already have, this app is unique in the fact that volunteers are alerted right away and can be in place pre or post a natural disaster to help with recovery of the area or the people that were affected. The next task during this stage is internal testing of the app. It is important that our team conducts multiple tests to see if the functionality of the app is working. Finally, I would like to test for bugs and performance or technical issues during this stage before we branch it out to others to test for us. 

#### Community and Partner Onboarding 
During the Community and Partner Onboarding stage, I would like to branch out and contract NGOs. It is important that we collaborate with those as well as local governments and relief organizations. This is the best way to promote the app. I would also like to look and implement accessibility features into the app. We want the app to be easy to use for everyone even if they have a disability. That is why I want to implement different settings to accommodate for that. Another task to complete during this two-month time frame would be to hold sessions to train users on the app. These users can be first responders and volunteers. This is important because they are going to be the first people who have access to the app and they need to know how the features work. The last step in this stage would be to have different users test the app. This would connect back to personas or victims. It is important that regular people test the app to see if there is anything that they do not like or if there are features, they would prefer to see before the app gets deeper into the process. 

#### Testing and Scalability Enhancements 
During this stage, I would like to expand user testing to regions with the most natural disasters. That way, we can determine if the app has any technical issues when there is an overload on servers. I would also start to implement the app in real natural disaster situations and gather feedback on what could be improved. This is an important step because in a real natural disaster, we do not want the app to stop functioning if users are relying on it to communicate with first responders. The last step in the testing and scalability enhancements would be to optimize cloud infrastructure for scalability. 

#### Full App Launch and Improvements 
During the Full App Launch and Improvements stage, we would launch automated disaster alerts and make sure that real time updates are working. This is an essential step because all users of the app need to be communicated with through alerts if there is a natural disaster near or close to them. We will also launch the app in different app stores for device compatibility, and we will investigate user feedback and see how the system is performing daily or in stressful situations. If there were any issues, we would get our technical team to fix it right away or we would come up with the best alternative if some features are not being used as planned. The last step would be to continuously improve security measures for users and make sure that the data being collected abides by regulations. This is important so the app is minimizing its data collection and there would be consent from users. 

#### Ongoing Tasks After the Launch 
The next stage would be after the launch. Things will not just stop. There will be ongoing tasks that need to be completed to make sure the app is working efficiently. These would include monitoring the system’s performance, implementing regular updates to keep the app running smoothly for users, and to keep expanding the app audience. It would also be beneficial to find more partnerships to help the app grow on a global scale once the app does well in each region of the United States. 

### Workflow Process 

### Timeline 

### Addressing Technical Debt 
By my choice of tools, it looks as though I will be in debt around $500,000 to start off. I think this is an accurate number because depending on scaling and features, I would still have to pay for app development, technology infrastructure, security and compliance, marketing, mapping tools, training, hardware and equipment, as well as all the individuals needed to make this app successful. Those people include software developers and engineers, UX/UI designers, Disaster response experts, Crisis mappers, Data scientists, Networking specialists, and Community volunteers. This Disaster Relief app would take technical debt to start running, but after some channeling from NGOs, humanitarian groups, and social media, there may be some funding help after. This cannot be relied on though. I think for the app to have all the features promised, I still need to spend while being money conscious. For example, I must spend money on security and compliance which could lead to potential debt. These features would include 2 Factor Authentication as well as End-to-End Encryption for sensitive data. This would be to make sure that the user’s data is protected and that communication on the app is not interfered with. For infrastructure, I was leaning towards cloud hosting which would help with scaling for many locations all over the country. Although, this would incur some technical debt in the long run because platforms like Firebase and Google Cloud have expensive hosting fees. 
Some ways that I can minimize technical debt is through using all the open-source technology possible. For example, I can use OpenStreetMap instead of Google Maps. If I was to use Google Maps, it would be easy to integrate but would have high usage costs as the platform grows. It is also important to invest in quality code and testing. I would put more money into this so that in the long run, there is fewer bugs and technical issues. This could be done by using unit and integration testing. It would also be crucial to have regular code reviews to prevent accumulation of technical debt. By doing this, technical debt could be decreased because prioritizing speedy delivery without correct code could be detrimental. Lastly, another major step would be to use GitHub to my advantage for comprehensive contributor documentation. This could help the onboarding process run smoother and can limit the cost I spend on developer documentation and community building. I would not want to rush anything in the development process because this can lead to lots of mistakes. Creating a plan of timeline, budget, and making sure communication is positive between team members could also minimize technical debt. 
Some of the potential sources of technical debt for my choice technical stack over a 5-year window would be from framework limitations, infrastructure scaling, third-party dependencies, and compliance requirements. Some frontend technical debt would be the use of a UI software framework called React Native. This platform would minimize not only costs but time as well because it allows a single codebase for iOS and Android. Some pitfalls of this would be the possibility of having to rewrite code for certain functions of the app and since the platform has updates often, this would lead to rebuilding UI components. This would probably cost more than $100,000 over 5 years. It is important to mitigate this by avoiding third party dependencies and to use code that can be reused. Cloud Hosting would also leave me in technical debt over a 5-year window because by using cloud cost scaling, storage costs will skyrocket as more people adopt and use the app. Data transfer costs would also increase technical debt because high API usage can be expensive for the mapping features of the app. Over 5 years this could cost around $500,000 and some mitigations for this would be to use hybrid cloud strategies and to optimize AI calls to decrease cloud expenses. The mapping feature of this app will also leave me in some technical debt because data ownership could become a problem if I were to use Google Maps. There would be no flexibility in the data usage and if users continue to use the app, it will cost more money to use the mapping features of that app in general. Lastly, over 5 years I would have to comply with different data privacy laws. I would have to make sure that the app is up to data on all privacy laws and regulations would be costly if there is a specific way data must be stored or encrypted. There could also be some security vulnerabilities if the app becomes popular. The Disaster Relief app could become a target for cyber security attacks, putting not only the victims of disaster in danger but the communication flow between responders would be diminished. To eliminate these concerns, it would probably cost around $200,000 over 5 years. To make sure that price doesn't increase, it would be beneficial to implement privacy focused infrastructure right away, conduct security testing, and follow data minimization practices. 

### Open Source Collaboration
This Disaster Relief app is built on open-source software and this is what makes it successful. From class, we know that open-source software is software that has source code publicly available for people to look at. Open source is important because it is a way to have transparency on the projects you are working on as well as including others in your work. The Disaster Relief app’s source code and design files will be publicly available on GitHub so that contribution is much easier. During the progress of creating the app, there will be guidelines for contributors and there will be issue tracking to make sure that everyone is completing what they are supposed to. Some of the contributors to the design and code would be developers, designers, disaster relief experts, data analysts, translators, and accessibility experts. By using open source, it is easier for people to write code, fix bugs, translate content, and improve the user interface. On GitHub, we will take advantage of Kanban boards to coordinate tasks, and we will use different platforms to ensure proper communication with one another. This would also be important if there were people in different time-zones working on the app. 

### Automation 
In class, we talked about the effectiveness of adding automation to our projects. There are multiple ways this natural disaster relief app would take advantage of automation. The first would be to automated resource updates. The app can use cloud functions to pull updated information from datasets or APIs. Some examples of where the datasets could come from would be local relief organizations or even government agencies. The map and locations within could also be updated periodically. This would be beneficial because users would know if the location were open or closed, they would know the current capacity and how many more people they could take in, and it could update volunteers on any supply shortages.  Another automation feature that will be used is for our alert system for incoming natural disasters. We can automatically send server weather alerts and could push evacuation notices by location. Another automation feature that would be used would be for GPS monitoring for volunteers. The system can check in on a volunteer if their location has not been updated within a certain amount of time. Automated reminders can also be sent to users’ phones like check-in or that their location is not updating. Finally, automation can be taken advantage of for volunteer assignments. After volunteer information is collected like where they are located, we can use automation to send them to different areas based on their proximity and current availability. 

### Project Management Strategies 
In class, we touched on the Agile approaches. Agile methodology would help me with iteration, adaptability, user feedback, and cross-functional collaboration. I would follow these approaches because they would be beneficial in helping me be altered of urgent needs like disaster alerts or technical bugs. Also, they could help me continuously evolve different features of the app like GPS tracking, volunteer coordination, and resource mapping. I could organize work and collaboration on the app to two-week sprints. In the first week we can build and test a feature, and the second week would be used for gathering feedback. User feedback is important, so we need to look at feedback from all our target audience. These groups include beta testers, NGO partners, volunteers, first responders, and victims. Another way to implement agile approaches into the app would be to have a product backlog. This backlog would keep coordinators on the app focused on the most important tasks at hand. The backlog can keep track of MVP (most urgent) tasks, technical debt, community requested (feedback), and goals for the project.

### Conclusion 
This Disaster Relief App was innovated to help with disaster response. It does this by streamlining coordination between victims, volunteers, first responders, and different organizations. The main goal of the app is to improve disaster preparedness and recovery. It does this by offering real-time communication and access to resources. By connecting collaborators and communities through an open-source centralized system, the app empowers users to act and respond quickly to detrimental situations. This app is efficient, inclusive, and ensures that assistance is given to those who need it most.

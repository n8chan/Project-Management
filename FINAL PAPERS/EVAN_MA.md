# Personal Portfolio Website

## Abstract
This project involves the development of a personal portfolio website hosted on GitHub, designed to showcase my coding projects, technical skills, and professional background. The website portfolio will be a website hosted on GitHub pages, acting as a digital and interactive resume. Built using HTML, Python, Jekyll, and the Altair visualization library, the site emphasizes interactivity and user engagement through content and embedded project demos. In addition to a portfolio of work, the site features a bio page to highlight academic and professional experiences. The project incorporates key principles of project management, including clear project scoping, sustainable design practices, and effective workflow planning. Special attention is given to community engagement through accessible design, as well as the long-term maintainability of the website by proactively addressing technical debt and integrating automation for updates and deployment. This website portfolio is not only an interactive resume but also as a practical case study in managing software development from inception to deployment using modern project management frameworks. Applying project management concepts and ideas learnt from class, the website should be streamlined and open source along with other principles.

## Purpose
A personal portfolio serves as a platform to present my technical abilities, completed projects, and professional identity. Unlike a traditional resume, a portfolio offers a deeper and more interactive view of your skills. It can include code samples, visualizations, project write-ups, and live demos, allowing visitors to engage directly with your work.
Having a portfolio is particularly useful when applying for jobs or internships. Recruiters and hiring managers often look for candidates who can not only talk about their work but also demonstrate it. By linking myGitHub-hosted portfolio in applications or on LinkedIn, I provide a way to validate your experience, technical fluency, and commitment to continuous learning. Professors or research mentors can also use it to better understand my skills, which may lead to recommendation letters, research positions, or collaborative projects. Peers could also gain inspiration or insights from my code implementation.
From a project management perspective, building and maintaining a portfolio is itself a full project lifecycle in action. It involves initial scoping (defining which projects or skills to highlight), scheduling and workflow planning, iterative development, and ongoing maintenance (e.g., updating with new work or addressing technical debt). Community and sustainability are considered through design choices like accessibility and clarity of documentation. Automation can assist in streamlining deployments and content updates. In this way, the portfolio is not only a product but also a practical exercise in applying core project management principles to your own career development.



## Workflow Map

| <b>Figure 1.</b> Workflow Map Timeline Over 12 Weeks |  

The workflow map provides an approximate timeline for completing my personal portfolio website. Thanks to prior work in other courses, I’ve already made some progress in the research and initial setup phases. Compared to the Kanban method discussed in class, this workflow map offers a clearer week-by-week timeline, which I find more effective for planning and visualizing how each step builds upon the last. It also highlights how tasks are interrelated, which helps me manage dependencies more strategically.
Using a workflow map is especially helpful in a solo project like this because it provides visual clarity and structure. It allows me to see how tasks are connected and which ones are dependent on others. It also makes the timeline feel less overwhelming by giving me smaller milestones to work toward. In essence, the workflow map acts as both a planning tool and a self-accountability mechanism, ensuring that I stay organized, realistic, and focused throughout the project lifecycle.

<ins>Research Phase<ins>

During this stage, I plan to explore library documentation in greater depth for tools like Jekyll and Altair. I will also research creative ways to transform static text or graphs into interactive visual elements. Rather than designing the front end from scratch (which is not my strongest area), I intend to customize an existing Jekyll template. This allows me to focus more on functionality and interactivity while maintaining a clean and professional aesthetic.

<ins>Setup Phase<ins>

This phase involves establishing the GitHub Pages hosting environment, writing initial scripts in VSCode, and implementing a draft version of the website using a chosen template. My goal is to develop a minimally functional site that compiles cleanly and is error-free, enabling a stable deployment to a permanent web address.

<ins>Feedback and Design Phase<ins>

In this stage, I will refine the site’s design based on my own usability testing and aesthetic preferences. I’ll also revise the order and content of the pages for better flow. Additionally, I may share the portfolio on developer forums or community spaces to gather external feedback both on visual design and overall efficiency.

<ins>Project Integration Phase<ins>

Here, I will organize and embed the projects I’ve completed in other classes or research roles. Each project will be linked appropriately within the portfolio, ensuring that source code is visible on GitHub and that any relevant datasets are accessible and displayed properly.
<ins>Final Touches Phase<ins>

The final phase will involve fixing any remaining bugs, polishing design elements, and ensuring cross-browser and mobile compatibility. At this point, the site should be fully functional, visually cohesive, and ready for public presentation.

## Open Source
An integral component of effective project management, especially in website development, is embracing the principles of open-source collaboration. By licensing my portfolio website under the MIT License on GitHub, I enable others to freely view, use, modify, and distribute the code. This aligns with broader open-source community values, where accessibility and reusability are prioritized to encourage innovation and peer learning.
To make the project genuinely open source, I will include a visible link to the GitHub repository on the front end of the website. This ensures that visitors, whether they are recruiters, peers, or fellow developers, can easily access the source code. The site will also include a comprehensive README.md file, which will serve as both a technical guide and a changelog. This file will be updated regularly to reflect any modifications, new features, or bug fixes made during the website's lifecycle, maintaining transparency in the development process.
In addition to the GitHub repository and README documentation, I plan to maintain open-source standards by properly versioning changes, clearly commenting code, and noting library or tool updates. This ensures that others can not only reuse the site as a portfolio template but also trace its development history and understand the rationale behind design and feature decisions. Through this approach, the portfolio becomes more than just a personal showcase, it also becomes a community resource and a reflection of best practices in project documentation, licensing, and sustainable development.

## Automation
Integrating automation into my portfolio project not only enhances efficiency but also aligns with best practices in modern project management. For instance, setting up GitHub Actions can automate issue tracking and send real-time notifications via email or platforms like Discord, ensuring that I stay informed about updates or potential issues without constant manual oversight.
Leveraging tools like GitHub Copilot further streamlines the development process. Copilot assists in generating code snippets, especially for repetitive tasks, allowing me to focus on more complex aspects of the project and reducing the time spent on routine coding.
complex aspects of the project and reducing the time spent on routine coding.
Additionally, some of the datasets featured in my projects are updated regularly. To ensure that my website always displays the most current information, I plan to implement automated data fetching using APIs. By integrating API keys and scheduling regular data pulls, the site will dynamically update content without requiring manual intervention.
These automation strategies resonate with the perspectives shared in the Journyx article, which emphasizes that while automation can handle repetitive and time-consuming tasks, it doesn't replace the need for human oversight and decision-making in project management. Instead, automation serves as a tool to enhance productivity and accuracy, allowing project managers to focus on strategic planning and creative problem-solving.

## Community 
Community engagement is an important part of both the technical and human side of my portfolio project. One way I plan to stay connected to the broader development community is by regularly reviewing release notes, changelogs, and discussion threads for the libraries I use such as Jekyll and Altair. Keeping up with community library updates ensures that my project remains compatible with evolving tools and allows me to adopt new features or bug fixes early on.
Feedback is another critical part of the community aspect. I plan to gather insights not just from peers and classmates, but also from users or developers who may come across my site. This could include adding a feedback form directly on the website or sharing updates and visuals in developer forums and online communities. This input will help me improve usability, catch issues I might overlook, and understand how others perceive the design and functionality of the site.
To make the portfolio even more interactive and community-friendly, I’m considering adding a “Connect” or “Blog” tab where visitors can learn more about me, leave feedback, or reach out for collaboration. Whether it’s receiving advice on better implementation techniques or simply sharing inspiration, fostering a two-way dialogue turns the site into more than just a static portfolio.

## Sustainability
Maintaining an open-source project isn’t just about publishing code, it’s about keeping it organized, secure, and functional over time. I may want to create multiple branches or forks despite working on the project independently. However, working independently does not mean I should let commits, merges, and pull requests hang around. Regularly closing pull requests helps keep the GitHub repo clean and structured, making it easier to track updates and avoid version confusion. 
Staying on top of library updates is also essential. Whether it’s ensuring interactivity features still work with Altair or keeping a Jekyll theme current so the front end displays correctly, updating dependencies prevents bugs and breaks before they happen. Release cycles matter, if a library becomes outdated or vulnerable (like with the Log4j issue), it could expose security risks or even backdoors. Currently, I plan on checking my website every few months or so even after the first year of the website launch. By treating this portfolio as a live, evolving project, I’m also practicing responsible technology transfer. It’s not just for me, it’s something others may use, fork, or learn from, so keeping it stable and secure benefits the wider community too. 

## Technical Debt
In developing my portfolio website, I’ve had to balance fast progress with long-term structure. I’ve chosen tools like Jekyll, GitHub, Python, and Altair because they’re widely used, well-documented, and backed by active communities. That support has made it easier to troubleshoot and iterate quickly, especially while I’m still learning front-end design. However, moving fast has also introduced some technical debt, mostly from prioritizing quick solutions over carefully planned architecture.
Manual updates and tool compatibility are another layer to consider. Community libraries like Jekyll and Altair evolve constantly, and even minor updates could introduce bugs or break features. Over time, dependencies may deprecate certain functions or change API structures, forcing me to refactor parts of my site. Interactive visualizations and third-party integrations can be especially fragile, as they rely on tools that may become outdated or unsupported. Periodic reviews and cautious updates will be essential to keeping the site functional and scalable.
One of the biggest risks I’ve identified is tied to account management. Right now, many of my tools and datasets are connected to my university email. Once that access expires, I could lose functionality or worse, access to code or data entirely. To reduce that risk, I plan to migrate everything to personal accounts as soon as possible. In the longer term, I also want to add more interactivity and customize the Jekyll theme. While those features will improve the user experience, they also increase the complexity of the codebase. Without a solid architectural foundation, customizations can pile up and make future maintenance harder. Ultimately, my approach is to keep building efficiently while staying mindful of structure, relying on reliable community-supported tools to help manage technical debt as the project grows.

## Challenges
As I continue building my portfolio, one of the most important but challenging tasks is clearly defining the project’s scope. Without thoughtful scoping, it’s easy to overshoot. Adding too many features, pages, or design elements that ultimately dilute the site’s purpose. One example is deciding how to organize my projects. Rather than grouping them by course, I’m considering organizing by topic or skill set, such as data visualization, machine learning, or automation. This structure feels more meaningful for recruiters or peers who want to see what I can actually do, rather than which class I took.
Another scoping consideration is deciding what kind of content belongs on the site. Should I include creative or personal coding projects alongside more professional, research-based work? Or should those live on separate pages or domains? I’m also reevaluating whether to keep certain sections, like a blog or discussion page if they don’t serve a clear purpose or if they add unnecessary complexity.
Compatibility and user experience are also top of mind. As I add interactivity through visualizations, links, and dynamic content, I need to make sure everything loads smoothly across devices and browsers. Too many interactive elements can also hurt accessibility or create clutter. So it’s a balancing act: building a site that’s rich and engaging without overwhelming visitors or breaking due to version conflicts or integration issues. Being intentional about scope helps keep the portfolio focused, user-friendly, and sustainable.

## Conclusion
Overall, this portfolio project has allowed me to apply both technical and project management skills in a meaningful, hands-on way. By leveraging tools like Jekyll, GitHub, Python, and Altair, I’ve created a foundation that not only showcases my work but also reflects a thoughtful approach to open-source development, automation, and long-term sustainability. Throughout the process, I’ve carefully considered factors such as project scoping, community feedback, technical debt, and user experience which are all essential elements of responsible project management.
Looking ahead, my goal is to keep refining and expanding the site as both my skills and experiences grow. In the short term, I plan to finalize project categorization, complete the integration of dynamic data visualizations, and migrate all key accounts to personal credentials for continuity. In the long term, I hope to improve the site’s interactivity, expand blog or reflection features, and eventually open the template for others to use and contribute to. By scheduling regular reviews, staying engaged with library updates, and maintaining clean documentation, I’ll ensure the portfolio remains both functional and future-ready. This project isn’t just a website, it’s an evolving reflection of my journey as a developer and learner. With thoughtful planning and consistent iteration, I hope it continues to grow alongside me.

## Illini Swap: Project Management
Kelly Tran, Spring 2025.


### Introduction    

Illini Swap is a mobile platform that encourages students to practice sustainable behavior through repurposing, reselling, and reusing items instead of purchasing new products. Not only does this help reduce the amount of waste in landfills, but it also limits the amount of carbon emissions produced by creating new products. Furthermore, it reduces the resources and energy needed to transport those new items. Due to the sheer size of the campus, platforms that allow students to easily make the right choice will make the biggest difference. Furthermore, Illini Swap aligns with the environmental sustainability initiatives on campus and establishes a community with students at UIUC. To implement this platform efficiently and effectively, Illini Swap was made an open-source project because it allows for transparency, collaboration, and accessibility, which aligns with this community-centered platform. Furthermore, this open-source approach allows for a diverse group of designers, researchers, developers, and contributors, which ensures that the platform fits the needs of all students from all different backgrounds. Furthermore, this approach encourages innovation, improvement, and accountability since many people can work on it. Finally, key project management principles will be applied to this project to help support development, engagement, and long-term sustainability. Understanding and applying these principles is crucial for open-source projects to avoid issues like technical debt, while also making sure the project is scalable, if need be, and resilient. Overall, proper project management allows the project to run smoothly and the goals of Illini Swap to remain clear and on track.

### Project Scope

The scope overview of the project would span over eight months to conduct proper user research, design, development, and maintenance of the mobile application. The deliverables include a minimum viable product (MVP) with core features such as searchable item listings, user profiles for listing items, messaging, managing meetups, and orders. Other long-term goals would include additional features such as a swap matching algorithm to improve app engagement, environment impact tracking, and integration of UIUC NetID to ensure safety and trust between students. Therefore, the stakeholders of this project would include students, developers, and sustainability clubs at UIUC (primary). Other secondary stakeholders include UIUC staff, administrators, and faculty members. Firstly, Illini Swap will be a mobile app to ensure that students have access to meetup and seller information while on the go. Although this project will only be available and focus on the UIUC campus and students, there is room for expansion across other campuses to prompt sustainability. In regards to the open-framing of the project, the codebase and design will be hosted on public platforms like GitHub and Figma. This will ensure productive collaboration, transparency, and accountability. This is a community-based project, so external contributors will be able to contribute to the project with clear guidelines, rules, and documentation. Documentation can include READMEs, guides, and code of conduct to smoothen the learning curve of joining the project as well as give a welcoming environment. For example, swimlane workflow diagrams (shown in Figure 1) are helpful for “a simplified process diagram for the workflow that can be easily maintained on an ongoing basis" (Waterhouse, 2021). It might be updated and changed depending on delays, resource access, goal shifts, etc.

### Principle #1: Discussions, Documentation, and Public Events

##### Discussions
Proper discussions, documentation, and public events are crucial to streamlining and strengthening the project and collaboration between contributors from all backgrounds. Since this project requires interdisciplinary groups to design and develop the mobile app. Discussions are extremely important to maintaining open and transparent communication in open-source projects. Having a place/platform where people can discuss issues, ask questions, bounce ideas off of each other, and share new progress can ensure that the community aspect of the project is strong. Furthermore, it ensures that contributors' goals and objectives align with Illini Swap. Additionally, it gives new incoming contributors an idea and understanding of the existing progress and status of the project. For Illini Swap, Github discussion would allow for real-time communication about technical issues, code, bugs, and general development discussion. Alternatively, for designers and UI/UX design insights and feedback Slack will be used for coordinating tasks, asking questions, and making quicker design decisions. Having specific channels like #design-feedback, #user-testing, etc. will help organize research and design progress and steps. Due to the project being open-source, not all contributors will be available at the same time. Therefore, asynchronous discussions allow contributors to review updates and stay involved while progress is being made throughout the process. Furthermore, if contributors have busy schedules and are working at later times, others can review and comment in the morning without needing everyone's schedules to align. Although discussions can be helpful like this sometimes if people are working individually at different times, it can feel less community-based and more individual. Therefore, “[t]o build trust and engagement in knowledge creation and sharing among users truly needs an enduring and evolving development process” (Landqvist et al., 2005, p. 373). To make sure discussions are productive and effective, there will be set guidelines, summaries, action items, etc. to reduce the amount of confusion and create a welcoming environment for new contributors.

##### Documentation
Open-source projects are bound to evolve and change over time so proper documentation is crucial to ensuring contributors have all the information and resources needed to contribute to the project. For example, a specific README file on GitHub will make the transition to working on the project smoothly. The README file would include the project’s aim (introduction), technologies, launch date, current state/step of the project (development and design progress), additional resources, and proper titles. It will be constantly updated to ensure no confusion and reduce the chances of technical debt and project abandonment. Other helpful documentation can be coding standards that provide information on how coding should be formatted, how to handle version control, and tips to have clean code. This will ensure that when errors arise or new contributors join the project, there is consistency, standards, and a lower learning curve for new contributors. Overall, including the tech stack for Illini Swap is important to make sure those who are willing to work on the project are familiar with the tools and software. The design aspects tools like Figma and Figjam will be used, whereas for development React Native, Firebase, and Node.js will be used. In addition for future scaling, a feature document will help keep track of current offered features, in-progress features, and any other new additional features that might have been collected during user feedback. 

##### Public Events
Another helpful project management tool would be public events. Hosting public events like design sprints, hackathons, and user feedback sessions can provide productive strides in progress while giving the project a sense of community. Design sprints open the project up to new and creative ideas to improve the project, whereas hackathons can help with solving and building the app. User feedback sessions will always provide new ways in which Illini Swap can be improved and made more useful to students and their sustainability journey. Not only will these events be productive for the project, but they can also help pique the interest of new contributors to join the open-source project and allow those who cannot commit to joining the project to participate. Overall, public events during UIUC Sustainability Week can help market the app to students who care about sustainability and increase traction/interest. Overall, it is important to list clear goals and guidelines for all these tools to be effective and beneficial to Illini Swap.

### Principle #2: Community Building
Another principle to follow includes community building, which includes open governance, contributor roles, dealing with technical debt, education, and building trust. All these aspects tie into the sustainability of not only the project but community involvement in general. Illini Swap is a community-initiated open-source project, meaning a project “initiated by one or more individuals independent of their employment context” (West & O’Mahony, 2005). Therefore, some challenges for community-led projects include the long process of creating critical mass and determining a project direction. Generally, this type of project differs from a sponsored project because community-led projects allow the early entrants to set the standard and norms within a project. Therefore, it is important to lay out those guidelines and have those important discussions to allow the project to make it past the incubation stage.
	Consequently, this raises the importance of distributed leadership. This ensures that not one person is overwhelmed and responsible for the entire project. Furthermore, in community-based projects, it is beneficial to give all team members a sense of ownership. Illini Swap will be a product of the entire team and built by contributors who care about the mission it seeks to portray. However, the leadership role can benefit from having a smaller group to help coordinate events and help increase engagement within the community. Furthermore, this group can rotate to help reduce the chances of burnout and allow everyone the opportunity to get more involved. Referring back to Figure 1, there are five different project groups, which means that those clear roles are defined at the beginning of the project. This allows people to choose what aspect of the project they are interested in and contributors have a clear understanding of what they are responsible for. Clear and good governance is crucial for transparent decision-making and clarification for the different processes (submitting features, bugs, features, etc.). For example, including clear purpose and clear roles for each team, having systems to hold individuals accountable for their actions (but also appreciating them as well), and including an ethical code of conduct in a governance model will guarantee structure and clarity in the project.

### Principle #3: Technical Debt
Additionally, technical debt is an aspect when it comes to open-source projects. For Illini Swap, technical debt can take form in both the design and development phases. UX/UI design can be very complex depending on the project, but specifically for Illini Swap, it can be difficult to maintain consistency. When designing in Figma, if quick fixes are constantly used, it can be difficult to maintain a consistent UI, which hinders the usability and appearance of the app. Furthermore, it increases the chances of contributors abandoning the project because the lack of color styles/presets, and spacing might make the design process unorganized and difficult to edit. The solution to reduce the chances of technical debt in the design process would be to create a thorough design system. Furthermore, it should be documented on Slack and Github, but it will also be set on the Figma File. This way contributors have multiple sources of information to refer back to and it will prevent accumulating debt. Technical debt in the development of Illini Swap would occur if developers rushed through building features quickly without keeping code quality in mind. This could mean skipping automated tests, code reviews, and using difficult values. The accumulation of these shortcuts can lead to more bugs and even more difficult fixes. Not only would this be frustrating to fix, but also steer away potential contributors. Although these shortcuts might save time initially, in the long term the project would slow down and it would be difficult to implement new features. Additionally, monolithic code (one large chunk of code) also makes it difficult to scale the project and add new features. To reduce technical debt incurred by this issue, this project will use a modular programming technique/system, which means breaking down the project into smaller pieces to help organize and make the project easier to manage. This is represented by the breakdown of researchers, designers, frontend, backend, and database management. Furthermore, those can be broken down even further to help with organization. Overall, utilizing GitHub to ensure stable versions are saved is crucial when changes and updates are constantly being made and tested. Using that GitHub tool will ensure that fixes can be found and made, which overall reduces the amount of technical debt incurred by this issue. Other forms of technical debt can include like lack of documentation and testing (Aurum et al., 2013). In order to avoid this, there will be allocated time to refactor the code in public events to maintain the code quality as new features are being added to Illini Swap. Furthermore, the documentation needs to be continually updated whenever a new feature is added to the application. Whenever the project makes progress on the workflow, highlighting where would be crucial for contributors and new potential contributors. Managing technical debt requires proactive actions like code reviews and having specific guidelines and progress that are followed.

### Conclusion      

Overall, Illini Swap represents a community at the University of Illinois that focuses on environmental sustainability. Additionally, it provides students with a platform to reuse, resell, and reduce waste. By implementing this mobile app with an open-source project approach, there is trust and transparency allowing the contributor (even UIUC students) to work on the project. Fostering trust can benefit the application and make it effective for the mission, but also be more helpful for students, the main audience, as well. Furthermore, the collaboration and community involvement that open-source projects rely on aligns directly with the mission statement of Illini Swap. Furthermore, open-source projects fit into the financial limitations of development and design, especially since this project is a community-led initiative. 
	By following key principles of project management, Illini Swap can be brought to life. Discussions, documentation, and public events provide the project with direction and structure to streamline the development of Illini Swap. It ensures that there is proper communication and engagement increasing the sustainability of this project. Furthermore, the key principle of community building allows for there to be trust and collaboration, which are crucial for successful long-term open-source projects. Finally, technical debt is known to be the shortcomings of many open-source projects, especially in non-sponsored projects like Illini Swap. Therefore, ensuring there are systems and resources in place to maintain consistent quality work throughout contributors will ensure Illini Swap can scale and grow. Not only will this lead a community to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly, but it will also establish and bring together people who want to collaborate to bring this process to life. Although this project focuses on the UIUC campus specifically, Illini Swap’s concept and mission can expand to other campuses and make a noticeable difference. College campuses are known for producing mass amounts of waste and numerous unnecessary purchases. Applying key project management principles and creating multiple open-source projects on other campuses, while using Illini Swap as the foundation can lead to great change and innovation. Furthermore, other tools like automation for simple tasks like scheduling user interviews, task allocation, etc. can help make the process of implementation and development smoother. Overall, these key principles can help streamline and make community-based projects productive.

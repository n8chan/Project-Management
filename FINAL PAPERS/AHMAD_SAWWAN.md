## Introduction
Today, the world is heavily reliant on technology and the internet, schools especially rely on this technology for education for their students, but sometimes it is hard for teachers to manage every student's questions and be able to get to everybody in a timely manner. In trying to find a solution for this, I found that it's not the teacher I should be focusing on, but the student. Creating a space where students can freely interact with each other and bounce ideas off of each other will significantly improve academics. Current websites or platforms that exist are either commercial or closed, so no one can really benefit from them and collaborate at the scale that we are able to have if using resources correctly.

## Open Source
Open-source software is becoming increasingly popular in today's age. According to an article by Marc Oswald, it is very beneficial due to it being flexible, having lower costs, and having the ability to foster innovation. The article states that using open source allows schools and districts to access and modify code in order to fit their own needs for education and integration with the other technologies that they have. This offers a sort of long term sustainability and lower total costs. Marc states that if a school chooses to go with proprietary software as its core, then it is locked into one solution for a long time which reduces flexibility, however using open source will enable them to move goalposts, policies, and strategies because it is very flexible (Oswald).

## Benefits of Collaborative Learning

Collaborative learning is a way to engage students together in their own learning space with each other. It helps create a community where no one feels left out or isolated while sharing responsibility of their learning. This can also help students improve their team building skills which is very important in life. According to Columbia, there was a positive correlation between collaborative learning and student achievements. It leads to increased student engagement, persistence, personal development, and improved achievement among the students. Creating an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcomed and can trust and respect each other will help community building and sustenance. Having a readme file that describes what this project is and how it will help students and people learn from each other through collaboration will be very important. Asking questions like “What do you hope to get out of this? What are your expectations?” can help us improve this app and show the development team what people expect and want (Resource).

## StudySpace
StudySpace is an open source platform that will take things to the next level. It will enable students, and possibly teachers if they want to, to collaborate with each other with no trouble. Using open source means this platform will be accessible to everyone, it will be free, and it will be community managed and run. It will be an environment where educators and learners around the world can share material, connect with each other, and create and join study groups for certain topics.
StudySpace will be built on open source, it will adhere to principles of working open, it will grant power to its users as contributors, all this in order to make sure that the platform is fully by the user and for the user.


## Vision Statement

The vision for this project is to create an environment where students, teachers, and any person can learn from each other in a collaborative space that has easy access and where everyone feels welcome.


## Features

The object of this project is to make education and learning opportunities more accessible to people worldwide. This is done by removing certain things that may get in the way of someone trying to learn, it opens paths through contribution and inclusivity. This project will enable users to have the ability to share resources like flashcards, notes, or any other study materials freely and openly. It will enable users to create groups within that can be accessed and used by other users to study based on their interests or subjects. It will have forums, documents, and more where users can edit and help each other in real time. API will be a big thing for this project as it will enable educators to use it to integrate it into already established systems to help students. It will also leverage AI and automation in order to help people find study partners based on performance, interest, and goals.
StudySpace will be mainly targeted toward students who want to enhance their learning experience, this does not mean exclusivity however, people who want to learn without being in school will also be able to leverage StudySpace as well as teachers who want to provide a better experience for their students. StudySpace will be available to anyone and everyone with openness at the core. All code, all documentation, and all decision making and processes will be public. Contributors, which could be anyone, will make the platform better every day which will ensure that StudySpace remains community driven.

## Community Governance, Transparency, and  Working Open

Community governance will be a huge part of this project. Community governance is where there are a set of policies in place that are monitored and enforced by the policymakers and members of the community. Even though a community that has no rules can be considered good, it lacks consistency and efficiency. Having community governance does not necessarily mean a concrete set of rules, the rules will change as the community grows and evolves in order to accommodate more members coming in (What).
Roadmapping is extremely important in projects like these. Roadmapping is a sort od description of products or services and how they will evolve as time goes on. If there are certain features or ideas that are going to be implemented in the future, then it would appear on the roadmap. Roadmaps are very important, when using a product or a website for something long term, you want to make sure that it does not disappoint in the future, you are basically investing into the future otherwise it is a waste of time, thats why road mapping is important. It gives the customer or user in our case reassurance that they are in the right place. It allows them to plan for changes and look forward to things that will keep their interest. It also shows the customer how management works, if you are able to trust in management and see that they are putting in effort and doing things the correct way, then you can trust them with your investments. 
StudySpace will focus heavily on Transparency and Working Open. Both these concepts were discussed in class and their applications will remain the same in this project. StudySpace will likely be developed in repositories such as Git Hub as it is the most popular and viable. This will include features such as opening issues, closing issues, and push and pull requests. It will also include roadmaps, recorded community contributions, and decision logs. It will also include guidelines on how to use and collaborate on certain projects. These features align very well with the concept of working open and transparent as the work is there for everyone to see and it is an inclusive environment where everyone can be a decision maker. Community Governance is an extremely important principle that this project needs in order to succeed. In order to ensure fully fair and effective management, this project will implement a governance model. There will be users, contributors, and project managers. The users are people who want to leverage this app to study or share their notes together. The contributors will be mainly focused on bug fixing, addressing any issues within the project, and documenting everything that happens. The project managers will have the job of reviewing code and releases while also overseeing management and project scope and direction. All of these activities will be fully transparent and available to the public in order to maintain integrity. Accessibility and Inclusivity are very important in today's world and will play a big role in this project. As I stated before, this project will be fully documented and transparent for the public to see. The project will be compliant with standards and will uphold these standards with a code of conduct that promotes inclusivity.
As previously stated, there will be three core principles that this project will uphold, Working Open, Issue Management and Project Roadmaps, and Community Development. In order to uphold working open, StudySpace will work with a transparent process. The source code will be made public in repositories, there will be discussions that are open to the community with suggestions and roadmaps available for everyone to see and give suggestions to. There will be labels that show all the work simplified in order for everyone to be able to understand. All this will help foster a community where everyone feels like they have made a contribution and know that they are the priority of this project. Since this is a collaborative heavy project, there will be very good issue tracking and road mapping. GitHub has a very good system for creating issues, these issues will be categorized into feedback, bugs, requests, and so on. Everyone can make a contribution and hopefully see their change implemented. Roadmaps will be constantly updated and users will be able to see things change in real time. StudySpace is also heavily focused on community development. I aim to do this by having many resources where people who want to contribute can learn and join the team. There will be programs in place to assist new contributors and open discussions with regular contributor meetings to review the scope of the project and make sure that everything is going smoothly.
This idea is very good on paper, however, there are some challenges that will be hard to overcome and must be discussed. Since this will be a project that promotes inclusivity and wants to make sure everyone feels welcome, it needs to have some sort of measures in place in order to handle the huge number of people that will potentially use it. New contributors may feel like they are behind or excluded since there is a great number of people and as new ones come in, they may feel like they are less than the senior contributors. That is why there needs to be a sort of guide in place that all contributors must read that shows every contributor is valued and needed. There needs to be mentorship programs for the new contributors that project experts will lead, hopefully, to showcase collaboration and friendliness. One more cool thing that could possibly be implemented is a sort of campaign every couple of months or so to showcase the new contributors and some work that they have done.
Another issue that may arise within this project is trolls. Since this is an open source based project, there is potential for trolls to emerge. Trolls are basically people who create a sort of disturbance within a community just for enjoyment, this could be in the form of spam, harassment, and any other behavior that is frowned upon. In order to combat this there needs to be a strict code of conduct in place that highlights punishment for this bad behavior. Moderators will of course be in place but because this is such a big project there needs to be some sort of AI leverage to help in moderation as well. The best way I can think of is a way that I witness in games. Usually, there is some sort of bot that tracks what is being said, that then is flagged and reviewed by a real person. If it turns out that it is something that goes against the code of conduct, bans will follow. There will be a zero-tolerance policy so the first offense that happens will result in an IP ban in order to make sure that they don’t come back. Another way to combat this is to also instill values of community respect, whatever you promote, will most likely be what happens.

## Challenges

This is a project that will see many years of contributions, I assume non-ending contributions. However, it is easy to get burned out when contributing to one thing for so long. In order to combat this, there will be milestones set and when achieved there will be celebrations. Community badges are a tool that many platforms use to keep interest, a sort of rank for people to earn through certain actions. Something that people can keep working towards. This plays to the sort of competitive nature of people but it should be done in a healthy way.

## Timeline

Weeks 0-4: In the beggining four weeks of this project, we will define the project mission and values. Setting up will be a very important phase as I will need to set up repositories, and some initial documentation about contributions and guidelines to ensure a smooth recruitment for contributors. Recruiting contributors will be going on during this process looking for passionate people who share the same vision as me in creating a environment where everyone can learn from each other.
Weeks 4-6: Since this is a project made for students and teachers, I will need to collect their input on ideas. Engaging with potential users will help shape the platform to meet needs that are real. This will be done mostly through surveys and interviews around campus. Making sure that the community is involved from the beginning stages will show people that this project cares about their opinions and actually needs them. 
Weeks 6-8:By this time I hope to have recruited some good developers. The development team will start creating prototypes for some key features that were collected from the community. Design will also be very crucial at this stage as we want something that will be intuitive and user friendly. 

Weeks 8-16: Core development phase, establish places to upload and share resources, group and community creation and joining, forums and discussions for the community

Weeks 16-24: Front end and back end integration, user friendly designs. API, storage, and user accounts.

Weeks 24-28: Early test launch. Gather feedback and fix bugs

Weeks 28+: Full release, and keep updating and fixing bugs as they are reported. Establish a governance system and plan for future expansion based on feedback.

## Conclusion
Overall, my vision for this project is a huge collaborative space for students, teachers, and just people in general to learn from each other. While there are many challenges that could come up, they will be dealt with by having complete transparency with our users, community governance structures, and a big focus on openness and respect within the community. 
By creating a space where education is at the center and making it more accessible, collaborative, and inclusive, this platform will create a truly beneficial learning experience for all. The center of this project being open source means that it will continue to evolve and grow as the community evolves and grows. This means that as new members come in from different backgrounds with different ideas, the platform will also have different ideas. StudySpace will be a project that empowers users and furthers their education step by step by being for the user and by the user.

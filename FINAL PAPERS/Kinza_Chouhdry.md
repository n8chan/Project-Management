### Abstract

MoodMate is an open design smart watch or phone prototype built by me and a group of students who worked on it in a previous class. This was designed on Figma to promote mental wellness through stress regulation, emotional awareness, and user personalization. MoodMate was intitally constructed for college students, but is open to all individuals. MoodMate offers users features like mood logging, breathing meditations, affirmations, and heart rate-based summaries. Though it is not a code-based project, MoodMate exemplifies the open source philosophy through transparent design processes, peer reviewed user testing, and documentation that invites collaboration. The users who were surveyed appreciated the clear design and thoughtful interactions, noting how the app felt consistent and easy to navigate. MoodMate empowers users to better understand and manage their stress in a way that fits seamlessly into their day.


### Introduction  

MoodMate was designed and created to support users in managing stress and building emotional resilience through simple and repeatable habits. Its vision is to offer a compact, wrist-based experience that encourages users to check in with themselves even on the busiest days. This design was heavily influenced by the concept of Fitness App on Apple's Smartwatch. As many individuals take to it for physical health purposes, MoodMate is another health tracking system. 

The motivation behind this project stems from the rising need for accessible mental health tools that meet users where they are. Unlike traditional therapy apps, which often require longer engagement or subscriptions, MoodMate provides brief, meaningful interactions through features like quick breathing exercises, mood logs, and emotion-specific affirmations. It transforms passive tracking into active support.

This project was born in a collaborative classroom environment, but it has since been reframed as an open and solo-developed wellness tool. Every design decision reflects the belief that mental health support should be intuitive, personalized, and inclusive. Though built in Figma rather than code, MoodMate still adheres to the principles of open design and community-centered development.

The app’s key innovation lies in connecting biometric data (heart rate) to personalized affirmations and trends, creating a seamless feedback loop between body and emotion. While the prototype is static, the workflows and feedback that shaped it reflect a philosophy rooted in accessibility, modular growth, and long-term relevance.
Recognizing the broader applicability of such a tool, I chose to develop MoodMate as an open-source project. This decision was rooted in the belief that mental health resources should be accessible to all, free from paywalls and proprietary constraints. By inviting collaboration and transparency, MoodMate aspires to evolve continuously, shaped by the diverse experiences and insights of its user community.


### Design Approach & System Overview

MoodMate was developed using Figma to simulate how a user might interact with a smartwatch interface for mental wellness. 

Its features include:

- Mood Logging with clickable emojis, streamlining user input

- Personalized Affirmations based on logged emotions

- Meditation Wheel with an adjustable timer and repeat function

- Heart Rate Summary Graphs by time of day

- Weekly Emotional Trends viewable in a clean, digestible format

Unlike apps that simply track moods or heart rate, MoodMate integrates those elements to deliver an adaptive experience. For example, logging “anxious” triggers a calming affirmation, while elevated heart rate data prompts the user with a supportive message when they open their summary.

The interface was deliberately kept minimal and color-coordinated for ease of use. Icons, font choices, and layout remain consistent throughout. Feedback from user testing indicated that users found the prototype intuitive and visually calming—key goals of the system design.

While the backend functionality is not yet implemented, the prototype serves as a strong foundation for future developers to build upon. With proper documentation and a working open roadmap, MoodMate is structured for scalable growth.


### Designing for Participation

From the start, MoodMate was shaped by community input. Through interviews, surveys, and usability testing with a diverse group of college students, the project collected ongoing feedback at each stage. This feedback influenced feature selection, UI improvements, and emotional tone.

Testers shared what they needed most from a mental health tool. Some wanted reminders. Others valued affirmations. Some preferred quick access, while others prioritized customization. MoodMate’s final feature set emerged directly from this dialogue.

The Figma prototype reflects this participatory spirit. It invites future users and developers to explore, critique, and build upon the design. By prioritizing clarity, accessibility, and inclusivity, the app removes barriers to contribution—even without a background in software development.

Participation also shows up in the documentation. All screens are labeled. Each interaction is annotated. Future collaborators can quickly understand both what the app does and why it was designed that way. This transparency makes MoodMate a living design project, not a finished product.


### Working Open in a Non-Technical Space

Working open is often associated with GitHub, commits, and code reviews, but MoodMate proves that these principles apply to design as well. Even without a technical stack, the project follows an open-source mindset by documenting decisions, inviting critique, and sharing materials freely.

The prototype and its summary evaluation report can be shared with designers, developers, and potential mental health partners. The process that shaped MoodMate—structured reflection, thematic analysis of survey data, and iterative redesign—mirrors open development methodologies.

The Figma file itself acts like a repo. Pages are versioned. Frames are labeled. Feedback from users is tracked and addressed. The design board is organized in stages, and annotations guide viewers through the logic behind each screen. These practices bring openness into the design space.

In a future iteration, MoodMate could benefit from migrating design documentation and discussion to platforms like GitHub or Notion to better support long-term tracking, user contributions, and public visibility. But even in its current state, MoodMate is proof that working open is more about mindset than medium.

### Designing for Sustainability
Sustainability for MoodMate means more than keeping the prototype functional—it means building a tool that grows with its users and their needs. That includes emotional sustainability: users should feel encouraged, not burdened, by their interactions with the app.

The app’s simplicity is part of this vision. No login, no long sessions, no gamification—just quiet nudges to reflect and recalibrate. Whether a user logs in once a week or multiple times per day, the experience remains positive, supportive, and respectful of their mental bandwidth.

From a design sustainability perspective, MoodMate avoids unnecessary complexity. Each feature stands alone but integrates naturally. For example, the mood log can be used independently, but when combined with heart rate data and affirmations, the insights deepen. This modular structure supports future additions like journaling, reminders, or therapist notes without breaking core functionality.

Long-term, MoodMate can be adapted into an open toolkit: downloadable Figma files, design documentation, and templated features that others can remix for their own wellness use cases. In this way, the project lives on as both a prototype and a design language—available to students, nonprofits, or developers aiming to expand access to mental health tools.



### Technical Vision & Implementation

MoodMate was developed using Figma, allowing for rapid prototyping and visual refinement without code. The app's interface features five core modules: Home, Meditation, Mood Log, Affirmations, and Summary. Each element was designed for minimal friction and maximum relevance to mental health needs.

The Home screen is clean and uncluttered, with clearly labeled buttons and subtle color schemes for a calming user experience. The Meditation feature includes an animated breathing wheel and now allows users to restart sessions, accommodating feedback that previous versions felt too rigid or time-consuming.

The Mood Log was one of the most significant updates, transitioning from manual input to interactive emotion buttons. Users select a feeling (ex. happy, stressed), explain its cause, and are then shown a targeted affirmation such as “I am worthy of feeling happy.” This integration of mood data with affirmations elevates the feature from passive tracking to active support.

The Summary module combines heart rate data and mood entries to show weekly patterns. Users can select a specific emotion to see when it occurred during the week, or explore heart rate trends across different times of day. These updates, based on user interviews, turned the summary from a static graph into an engaging and reflective space.

Figma’s interface was instrumental in making MoodMate’s design accessible for iteration. The team prioritized visual continuity, spacing, and icon consistency to make the app feel cohesive. Elements such as color schemes, gradients, and consistent font use were carefully applied to reduce cognitive load and enhance emotional ease—particularly critical for users already experiencing stress.

### Evaluation and Feedback

To assess MoodMate’s effectiveness, an evaluation was conducted with a sample of 12 undergraduate students representing diverse majors and years. Participants interacted with the prototype independently and responded to a combination of scale and open-ended questions, evaluating satisfaction, usefulness, and interface appeal.

The average satisfaction score was 4.0 out of 5, with users praising the simplicity and consistency of the design. The Mood Log and Summary features were frequently cited as favorites, especially for their clarity and emotional relevance. However, some users expressed a preference for mobile apps over smartwatch use, indicating future potential for a cross platform development.

Qualitative feedback underscored recurring themes of aesthetic appeal, emotional accessibility, and clarity of navigation. One participant shared that “the breathing exercises were my favorite—it was nice to have a feature that helped me calm down instantly.” Another noted that the summary feature allowed them to “see emotional patterns and reflect on how different moments affected their mood.”

This feedback reaffirmed the value of linking emotional insights with interface design. While not everyone owned a smartwatch, the overall consensus was that if such a tool existed, it would serve as a helpful companion for moments of stress.



### Workflow Process & Project Management



MoodMate follows a user-centered development path that integrates both design thinking and iterative refinement. While the current prototype exists in Figma, a full app build would follow a structured timeline involving planning, development, testing, deployment, and ongoing maintenance.


The roadmap breaks down as follows:

Planning (1–2 weeks): Research and feature scoping are prioritized. MoodMate’s goals around stress reduction, personalization, and affirmations are outlined with input from target users.

Development (4–6 weeks): UI construction occurs in Figma, while a potential technical version could involve front-end development with React and a Django backend. At this stage, features like mood logging and biometric feedback would be translated into code.

Testing (2–3 weeks): Feedback loops are central to this phase. Users test interactions, provide insight on usability, and suggest changes. Bug tracking, UI polishing, and validation of emotional feedback pathways are all refined here.

Deployment (1 week): A beta version of the smartwatch app is launched, ideally to a pilot group. Usage metrics and initial impact are monitored closely.

Maintenance (ongoing): Updates, bug fixes, and scaling are addressed continuously. This phase reflects MoodMate’s open-ended growth potential, allowing for future integration of journaling features, multilingual support, and real-world implementation with wearables.



### Community Building and Engagement
MoodMate is not just a prototype; it is a quiet invitation. It invites users to reconnect with themselves, and it invites collaborators to reimagine how wellness tools are made, shared, and supported. Though designed in Figma and not built on code, MoodMate applies the open-source principles of participatory design, transparency, and sustainability at every step.

By prioritizing emotional intelligence, user feedback, and modular growth, MoodMate offers a replicable model for open-source mental health projects—especially in non-technical spaces. This project reflects the belief that working open is not reserved for codebases, but belongs to any system designed with care, clarity, and collaboration in mind.

### Conclusion      
The creation of MoodMate highlighted the transformative power of listening-to users, to design patterns, and to shared emotional needs. Although the tool exists only in Figma, its functionality reflects real world problems and user-desired solutions.

One of the most important takeaways was the role of emotional context in interface design. Every feature, from mood logs to meditation wheels, had to not only function smoothly, but also feel supportive. The balance between technical clarity and emotional resonance shaped every decision.

The project also reinforced that open collaboration doesn’t always need a codebase. Figma, interviews, and user surveys formed a collaborative loop, where ideas could grow and adapt without technical barriers. In this way, the project expanded the meaning of working open-demonstrating that shared impact can arise from shared design.

MoodMate serves as both a project and a prototype for broader design thinking: empathetic, iterative, and responsive. Whether or not it becomes a full app, it reflects a vision of wellness tools that are human-centered and community-conscious. And that vision, even in its simplest form, has value.

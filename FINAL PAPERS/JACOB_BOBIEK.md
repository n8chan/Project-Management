At its core, **CourtGuard** will be a meeting ground for various researchers, athletic trainers, coaches, and even players to engage and develop on the mounting body of knowledge regarding basketball **ACL** injuries. The platform will begin with four major spheres:

- a specialized repository of information  
- collaborative analysis capabilities  
- exchange of knowledge of prevention methods  
- outreach to the community  

The concentrated repository of information will concentrate primarily on significant points of data of basketball **ACL** injuries, including comprehensive classification of the injury, like **jump shot landing**, **sudden pivot**, **direct contact on a drive**, grade of the tear like, **partial**, **complete**, specific recovery timelines with significant rehabilitation milestones, and comprehensive analysis of return-to-play attempts, like performance metrics and any instances of re-injury. Where possible, the platform will also attempt to incorporate factors found within research, like **knee joint angles** during the moment of injury, along with necessary contextual data such as the **playing surface**. Also, player demographic details such as **age group** or **level of competition**. This structured data will serve as a foundation for joint analysis that will discover patterns and risk factors intrinsic in the motions used in the game of basketball.

**CourtGuard**, in its early phases, will offer users basic but strong joint analysis functionality. These will be the visualization of injury patterns as frequency distributions so that users will be able to directly visualize high-risk positions of players or common situations of injury. The website will also provide capabilities to **compare recovery periods**, **compare outcomes by different injury types or rehab protocols**, and **analyze correlations of different points**. Data may also be **filtered and sorted** by selected criteria to enable targeted investigation of specific aspects of basketball **ACL** injuries. The ability of the users to **mark and share their analytical insights** will lead to collective knowledge of the data.

## **Guiding Principles**

# Mental Health Support App
**Yu Xia – IS 340: Project Management, Spring 2025**


### Background   
In recent years, mental health issues have become increasingly prominent among young adults, especially students and early-career professionals. With limited access to affordable therapy and growing academic and workplace stress, many individuals are left without structured emotional support. Recognizing this gap, I developed a plan for a small-scale mobile app that integrates mindfulness practices with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) tools. This app is designed to provide accessible, self-guided mental wellness support in a way that is simple, non-intimidating, and habit-forming. Drawing from personal experience and community observations, the goal is to offer a toolkit that empowers users to regulate emotions and build resilience in everyday life.

### Purpose
The purpose of this app is to offer a reliable, approachable entry point for users who wish to improve their mental health through daily self-reflection, emotional tracking, and guided meditative practice. Unlike clinical therapy platforms, this tool focuses on consistency over complexity. It supports users in establishing mental wellness habits through CBT-based journaling, mindfulness routines, and mood monitoring. The app’s flexible design allows users to choose the level of engagement that works for them while promoting emotional self-awareness. It also emphasizes simplicity in user experience to reduce cognitive load and avoid overwhelming those who may already be under emotional strain.

### Vision Statement     

To support the emotional well-being of young adults through a lightweight, accessible mobile app that blends CBT techniques and mindfulness routines to promote healthy, sustainable mental habits.

### Target Audience

This app is designed for individuals who want to take the first step in improving their mental health, especially:

-College students facing academic pressure and social stress.

-Early-career professionals dealing with transition and burnout.

-People who are unfamiliar with therapy but are interested in emotional self-care.

-Users who benefit from structured journaling, guided meditation, or mood tracking tools.

The app is also intended to be inclusive of neurodiverse users and those with mild anxiety, offering flexible entry points and simple interfaces without judgment or complexity.


### Features      
The app includes the following planned features:

-Guided Meditation: 5–10 minute audio sessions designed for stress relief and focus.

-CBT Journaling Templates: Structured prompts based on cognitive restructuring and thought tracking.

-Mood Tracker: A visual tool for logging daily emotions and identifying emotional trends over time.

-Habit Reminders: Non-intrusive push notifications to encourage regular reflection and mindfulness.

-Minimalist Design: Focused on clarity, calmness, and accessibility.

-Future Additions: AI-generated journaling prompts, optional voice logging, and customizable themes.

#### Research and Planning

In the early stages of the project, I focused on understanding the needs of the target users through informal conversations and secondary research. Based on this, I drafted the core features and defined user journeys. I created low-fidelity wireframes in Figma to explore layout options, test user flow, and refine interaction logic. The planning also involved outlining an Agile-inspired workflow with flexibility built into each phase to allow for feedback and change.

#### Prototyping and Testing

In this phase, I designed a clickable prototype using Figma, applying principles of clean UX/UI tailored for emotional wellness tools. I tested core interactions such as mood logging and guided journaling with a small group of peers. Their feedback was used to simplify navigation, reduce visual clutter, and improve the clarity of written prompts. I also planned future testing sessions focused on accessibility and emotional response.

#### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Build

The MVP will be developed using React Native for cross-platform support. The goal is to implement core features—guided meditation, journaling, and mood tracking—in a clean, usable interface. I will use GitHub to manage tasks and documentation, with a Kanban-style issue board to track priorities and bugs. Basic analytics will be integrated to monitor feature engagement for future refinement.

#### Beta Testing and Feedback Integration

After the MVP is functional, a small closed beta will be launched with selected users. The feedback gathered from this stage will help improve content tone, fix UI inconsistencies, and identify underused features. Features that prove difficult to use or redundant will be retired or replaced.

#### Expansion and Maintenance

Future iterations will focus on expanding journaling prompts using AI models, adding accessibility options like font scaling and dark mode, and preparing for potential open-source contributions. Regular update cycles and a lightweight feedback loop will guide the development roadmap.

### Workflow Process
Research → Design → Develop → Test → Improve

### Open Source Collaboration

This project is planned as an open-source project. I will use GitHub to host the source code and documentation. This makes it easier for others to join, give feedback, or contribute code. I will write clear README files and instructions so new contributors can understand the goals and how to participate. I will also use the GitHub Issues and Discussions tools to track bugs, feature requests, and community input. Open source is important for this kind of wellness tool because it supports transparency, accessibility, and continuous improvement.

### Project Management Strategies

For this project, I use an Agile-inspired method. I break the work into phases, with flexible tasks and room for feedback. Each feature is tested before moving to the next one. I also keep track of progress using GitHub with a Kanban-style board. I use sprints to focus on small goals, like finishing the mood tracker or improving the journaling prompts. I also review what works and what needs to change after each sprint. This method helps me stay organized and ready to improve the app based on real user needs.

### Conclusion

This project is a development plan for a mental health support app that brings together CBT and mindfulness in a simple, useful way. The app is designed for people who want to take small steps toward better mental health. By using principles from this course—like working open, thinking in feature lifecycles, and managing projects with flexibility, which I created a realistic plan for building and testing this app. I hope this project shows how even a small team can create something helpful by using good planning and focusing on real user needs.

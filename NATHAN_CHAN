# Spotty: A Social Music Rating App

## Project Vision

The **Spotty** project was created from a passion for music and digital interaction. As streaming services become more ubiquitous, a gap persists in how users share and discover music through personal and communal expression. Spotty aims to close that gap by building a **social music discovery platform** that combines **rating and review functions** with real-time local and networked trends. 

It is built on principles of open collaboration, distributed community input, and an agile approach to iterative development. The community Spotty serves includes college students, hobbyist music critics, and everyday listeners who value shared taste and social insight. The goal is to build a peer-driven, flexible app that expands musical discovery beyond the algorithm and into the community.

## Why This Project and Community Matter

This project is personally meaningful because it builds on everyday musical habits while inviting users to be **more than consumers**. As someone who has found musical communities meaningful and identity-shaping, the absence of deeper tools for social commentary and collaborative curation on platforms like Spotify is noticeable. 

**Spotty responds to this lack**, giving users the tools to express themselves musically, be heard, and discover music through others in a way that reflects real-world social dynamics. It applies “working open” practices not only in its development philosophy but in how users engage with the product and each other. This reflects a broader interest in **participatory media** and **peer production**.

## How Spotty Will Be Built and Managed

Although the project includes coding and technical execution, much of its success depends on **community workflows** and **iterative collaboration**. Spotty is organized using **GitHub** and version control tools to enable transparency. It integrates project boards, issues, and milestones to facilitate **agile development**.

Each sprint involves research, design, feedback, testing, and adjustment. A roadmap is publicly accessible, allowing for user and contributor input. Weekly progress updates, public demo sessions, and an onboarding pipeline for contributors help maintain steady development. Community-building efforts include a **Discord forum**, regular check-ins, newsletters, and contributor badges to recognize participation. 

## Concepts from the Course and Optional Readings

The Spotty project integrates five key principles from this course and its recommended readings:

- **Working Open** (Mozilla Foundation): Spotty encourages transparency and community participation at every level, including roadmap visibility, open documentation, and modular feature contributions.

- **Open Source Project Management** (Fogel, 2005): Following Fogel’s guidelines, Spotty will use contributor-friendly GitHub workflows, assign maintainers, and foster an inclusive environment with clear contribution guidelines.

- **Agile Practice** (PMI, 2017): Spotty implements sprint planning, retrospectives, user feedback loops, and iterative releases, following agile techniques to adapt to changing needs.

- **Open Education and Adaptability** (Jhangiani & Biswas-Diener, 2017): Openness in both technical and social dimensions guides Spotty’s scalability and responsiveness to community feedback.

- **Project Lifecycle Phases** (Watt, 2014): The project is divided into clearly defined phases, each with specific tasks, goals, and feedback checkpoints.

## Workflow and Development Timeline

| Phase | Description | Weeks |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Phase 1: Initial Setup** | Assign roles, define scope, configure GitHub repo, set documentation | 0–4 |
| **Phase 2: User Research** | Surveys, interviews, persona building | 4–8 |
| **Phase 3: Design** | Wireframes, user flow tests, feedback loop | 8–11 |
| **Phase 4: Usability Testing** | Test flows, collect feedback, prioritize revisions | 11–13 |
| **Phase 5: Front-End Implementation** | React Native build, branding, accessibility | 13–17 |
| **Phase 6: Back-End Development** | Firebase + Spotify API, secure data structures | 17–22 |
| **Phase 7: Beta Testing** | 30 testers, analytics, bug reports | 22–24 |
| **Phase 8: Launch** | Release on app stores, online promotions, patch updates | 25 |

## Sustainability and Scalability

Spotty’s post-launch strategy includes:

- Scaling through MVP refinement
- Expanding its contributor base
- Maintaining documentation in **ReadtheDocs**
- Providing how-to videos and contributor guides
- Reducing technical debt through regular sprints and automated tests
- Implementing a **content moderation roadmap**

To scale effectively, Spotty will use **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** that align both development and community goals. Metrics of success will include:

- Active user growth
- Contributor engagement
- Playlist shares
- Bi-weekly community calls and monthly maintainer reviews

## Conclusion

Spotty is more than a music app. It is a **collaborative platform** for music lovers to engage **critically, socially, and creatively**. By integrating open-source principles, agile project management, and user-focused design, Spotty redefines what it means to **listen socially**.

The project reflects a synthesis of lessons from IS 340—especially around working open, sustainability, and community management. Ultimately, Spotty shows how student projects can connect **personal passion** with **practical, distributed innovation**.

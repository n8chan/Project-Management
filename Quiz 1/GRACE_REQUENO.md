# Hi everyone! My name is Grace :)

I am a Junior at UIUC studying Information Sciences + Data Science with a special interest in machine learning and UI/UX design, and topics in either finance or biology/chemistry (some very different topics!)

## Here are some fast facts about me!

1. I started learning how to longboard about a year ago, and just recently picked up skateboarding! It's surprisingly pretty different which I found interesting..

2. In my free time, I love cafe hopping! Some of my favorite spots on campus are Yummy Future and Caffe Bene
My favorite order would be a matcha-ube latte

3. I have always loved art; but I definitely prefer painting over drawing. I find it a lot easier to make something out of mistakes with paint whereas drawing feels more permanent!

## Here are some of my newest obsessions!
| Series | Character & Why | Picture | 
|------------|------------|------------|
| Pokemon | Maushold is my favorite Pokemon - They remind me of my family! | <img src = "https://archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/f/f4/0925Maushold.png" alt = "Maushold"><br> |

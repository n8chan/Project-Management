# Hi, I'm Kohta!

I am a senior majoring in Information Science and Data Science. I'm graduating this semester!

## Fun Facts about me
1. I am from Tokyo, Japan. Yes, born and raised in Japan. I moved to US for my college, so I am planning to go back to Japan after my graduation.
2. I have a black-belt in Judo. I have been playing Judo since I was 4 years old. The reason why I started Juso is that my grandfather and [great-grandfather](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%B0%E5%8E%9F%E5%8B%87) was a national champion.
3. I play rugby at here, UIUC. Many people surprise that the rugby club exists on campus, but we are competing in D1, and we are the biggest college rugby team in the nation!

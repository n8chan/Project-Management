## I'm Christy!

I am a senior in Information Sciences and I'm currently thinking about pursuing Project Management as a career.     

### I really like cooking and going to the gym! 
My image has a few Cantonese dishes that I love eating:
- **Wonton Noodles** - Usually a chicken based soup with egg noodles and pork filled dumplings!
- **Beef Chow Fun** - A stir-fried rice noodle dish that comes with onions, beansprouts, and beef!
- **Coconut Pudding** - A cold, sweet, pudding made from coconut milk and gelatin!
- **Cheong Fun** - A steamed rice crepe that's usually served with a sweet soy sauce and fillings!
- **Hong Kong Milk Tea** - A classic drink from Hong Kong consisting of a black tea base with condensed milk and evaporated milk!

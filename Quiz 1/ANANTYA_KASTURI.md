# Hi! I'm Anantya Kasturi  
I'm a junior in IS+DS and can't wait to learn more about Project Management!  

## Some random facts about me:  
- I love spring and bright colors

## My favorite numbers:

| Number | 7    | 21    |  
| :-----: | :---: | :---: |  
| Why | 7 is my lucky number because I was born on that day   | I just like 21, no particular reason   |
